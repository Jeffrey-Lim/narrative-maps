Yamil Lage/Pool via Reuters/File Photo HAVANA, April 16 (Reuters) - Raul Castro confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress that kicked off on Friday, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel. In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said the new leadership would be party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit."" Castro had said at the previous party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the ""historic generation"" who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a U.S.-backed dictator in the 1959 leftist revolution. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register He already handed over the presidency in 2018 to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, who ran the party in two provinces before joining the national government. The new generation of leaders, which did not forge itself through rebellion, has no easy task. The transition comes as Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, while there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana. The congress, the party's most important meeting, held every five years to review policy and fix leadership, is a closed-door event but excerpts are being broadcast on state television. Castro himself became acting president when Fidel fell ill in 2006 and later in 2011 party leader, launching a raft of social and economic reforms to open up one of the world's last Communist-run countries that later stalled. On Friday, he hailed Diaz-Canel as one of the new generation of leaders that was picking up where he left off. Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege, who is widely expected to succeed him as party first secretary, the most powerful position in Cuba's one-party system. Older Cubans said they would miss having a Castro at the helm, although most acknowledged it was time to pass on the baton. ""It's another stage,"" said Maria del Carmen Jimenez, a 72-year old retired nurse, ""but without a double we will miss him."" Castro denounced renewed U.S. hostility under former President Donald Trump. Incumbent President Joe Biden has vowed to roll back some of Trumps sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities. Castro said Cuba was ready for a ""new type of relationship with the United States without ... Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism."" PRESSURE TO REFORM Cuba's new leaders face pressure to speed up reform, particularly economic change, which is foremost on citizens' minds, especially younger Cubans who have known only crisis, analysts say. A tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in Cuba's ailing centrally planned economy. Shortages of even basic goods mean Cubans spend hours lining up to buy groceries. And Havana has dollarized parts of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy. Since the expansion of internet access in recent years, Cubans are increasingly using social media as a platform to express criticism, while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media. Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide on issues as varied as excessive red tape to curbs on civil liberties. Castro said on Friday it was important to pursue reform with greater ""dynamism"", denouncing - as he has in the past - ""inertia, conformism, the lack of initiative"" in state companies. The government has resumed a set of economic reforms the party agreed on at its 2011 congress in recent months, in particular eradicating Cuba's dual currency, multiple exchange rate system in January. Yet Castro said reforms fomenting the non-state sector should not go beyond certain limits that would lead to the ""very destruction of socialism and the end of national sovereignty."" Party militants like Rogelio Machado, a mathematics teacher, say they were confident the new generation was up to walking that tightrope. ""Our country need changes and the new generation is more scientifically prepared to continue the path of socialism,"" he said. But government critics like ""artivist"" Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom Havana accuses of being part of a U.S.-backed soft coup attempt, say the death knell is sounding for the revolution. ""Raul is passing over the power to someone with little charisma and who does not have much popular support,"" he said while staging his latest performance against the government, in which he sits in a garrote for the four days of the congress. ""This takes us one step closer to democracy.""

1,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/raul-castro-cuba-communist-party-resigning,"Raul Castro has confirmed that he is resigning as head of Cubas Communist party, ending an era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution. The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement on Friday in a speech at the opening of the eighth congress of the ruling party - the only one allowed on the island. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana. He said he was retiring with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland"". Castro did not say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cubas one-party system. His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades, Cubans will not have a Castro formally guiding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead. The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality. Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called ""historic generation"" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy. In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the islands dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise - a category long banned or tightly restricted - permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes. This years congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

2,https://www.trtworld.com/americas/castro-says-he-is-retiring-but-will-keep-defending-cuba-s-1959-revolution-45975,"Fast News In a speech at the opening of the 8th Congress of the ruling party, Raul Castro said he was retiring with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland."" Picture released by Cuban News Agency (ACN) of Cuban First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro speaking during the opening session of the 8th Congress of the Cuban Communist Party at the Convention Palace in Havana, on April 16, 2021. (AFP) Raul Castro has confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the all-powerful Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel. In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said on Friday the new leadership were party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit."" Castro had said at the last party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the ""historic generation"" who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a US-backed dictator in a 1959 leftist revolution. He already handed over the presidency to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, in 2018. The Congress is the party's most important meeting, held every five years to review policy and fix leadership. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention centre in Havana. The congress is a closed-door event but excerpts are being broadcast on state television. Castro hailed Diaz-Canel as one of the new generation of leaders, praising the ""good results"" he had achieved in his three years in office. Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege who is widely expected to succeed him as party first secretary, the most powerful position in Cuba's one-party system.

A tightening of the decades-old US trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in the ailing centrally planned economy, which was already struggling following a decline in Venezuelan aid. That has led to shortages of even basic goods, with many Cubans spending hours lining up to buy groceries.

US President Joe Biden, who took office in January, has vowed to roll back some of Trump's sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities. Castro said Cuba was ready for a new relationship. ""I ratify from this party congress the will to develop a respectful dialogue and edify a new type of relationship with the United States without, in order to achieve it, Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism,"" he said.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Discontent has been fuelled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality. READ MORE: Hit by US sanctions, Cuba and Iran join hands to secure Covid-19 vaccine 'Historic generation' Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called ""historic generation"" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy. In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the islands dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise, a category long banned or tightly restricted, permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes. This years congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities. The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society. Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism. He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution. Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016. Small changes The PCC has said its congress, held 60 years after Fidel Castro officially declared Cuba's government a socialist one, would ""review core issues of the political, economic and social life of the country."" There are some signs that Cuba's leadership will have little choice but to increasingly balance the interests of the old guard with a clamor for more rights and better quality of life from younger generations. In February, it opened the bulk of its government-monopolised economy to entrepreneurs in the private sector. There have also been small nods to social liberalisation. In recent months, the government held its first-ever talks, though short-lived, with pro-free speech protesters, after authorising in 2019 Cuba's first non-political demonstration, by animal rights activists. 'Subversion' The arrival of the internet on mobile phones at the end of 2018 has made for a paradigm shift in Cuba, with never-before-seen access to information and new forums for expression and even limited protest. In response, the PCC has said one of the functions of its congress would be ""confronting political and ideological subversion, which has made the internet and social media its principal field of operations."" Castro told the congress he was retiring as ""a simple revolutionary fighter. ""Let there be no doubt, as long as I live, I will be ready... to defend the homeland, revolution and socialism,"" he said to loud applause.

Castro had said at the last party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the ""historic generation"" who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a US-backed dictator in a 1959 leftist revolution. The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society. Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

(Ariel Royero/Prensa Latina/Handout via Xinhua) by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) kicked off Friday at Havana's Convention Center, chaired by Raul Castro, first secretary of the PCC's Central Committee, and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel. During the presentation of the Central Report to the Eighth Congress of the PCC, Castro said that Cuba has preserved important social achievements in education, healthcare and social security, despite the intensification of the U.S. embargo against the island. Castro, 89, expressed his ""will to develop a respectful dialogue and build a new type of relationship with the United States,"" saying, ""Cuba will not give up on the principles of the Revolution and socialism."" He also called for improving the performance of the local economy and consolidating relations with governments and parties from different nations, including China. ""As far as I am concerned, my work as the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba has come to an end, with the satisfaction of having accomplished my duty and with confidence in the future of the homeland,"" he added. The Congress takes place as the island marks the 60th anniversary of the victory against the U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion and the declaration of Cuban socialism. With senior party leaders and delegates from all over the island in attendance, the meeting is scheduled to conclude on Monday. Addressing the audience during the opening speech, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, second secretary of the Central Committee of PCC, said that the political organization ""guarantees national unity and represents the ideals of dignity, justice and social independence"" for which generations of Cuban patriots have fought. Wearing face masks and abiding by social distancing guidelines, delegates discussed ideology, updating of the Cuban model, internal functioning of the PCC as well as the economic transformations implemented over the past five years since the last party congress. ""Dreaming and pushing a country forward: Our eighth Congress of the PCC starts today, the congress of continuity. It is here where ideas are rooted, history is acknowledged and the future is discussed. We are Cuba, we are continuity,"" Diaz-Canel said on Twitter earlier on Friday. Iroel Sanchez, a Cuban political commentator, told Xinhua that the Cuban Revolution will not only continue to stand on its own feet but actually has a lot to offer to a world that needs the Caribbean nation's example. ""We have many challenges ahead, but the Cuban people have shown evidence of huge reservoirs of intelligence and humanism instilled in it by socialism,"" he said. Nationwide, Cubans followed news on the opening ceremony of the Congress through state media's coverage. Among them is PCC member Sonia Cruz, a 60-year-old state employee from Havana's 10 de Octubre district. ""This is a historic Congress for Cubans who are called to continue defending the social achievements of our socialist system,"" she said, adding, ""The Communist Party of Cuba guarantees unity and continuity of the Cuban Revolution.""

By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's Communist Party kicked off a historic four-day congress on Friday that will see the last Castro exiting the political stage after six decades of rule by brothers Fidel and Raul following their 1959 leftist revolution. Raul Castro, 89, has signaled he will step aside as Communist Party first secretary, the most powerful job in Cuba. The congress takes place every five years for the organization to review policy and name its leadership. While the congress takes place behind closed doors, the party tweeted a video showing hundreds of delegates at a convention center in Havana greeting Castro with a standing ovation early on Friday. Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, who is widely expected to take over the party leadership. The new generation of leaders, which did not forge itself through rebellion against a U.S.-backed dictatorship like the ""historic generation,"" will have no easy task. The congress takes place as Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, and there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans. ""My generation does not want to take the dull path of my parents' generation,"" said Havana resident Guillermo Estrada, 31, adding he had no idea what would arise from the congress as it was all so secretive. ""I wish for a better future without so many internal and external restrictions."" New U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in the ailing centrally planned economy, which was already struggling following a decline in Venezuelan aid. That has led to shortages of even basic goods, with many Cubans spend hours lining up to buy groceries. The dire situation has pushed the government to speed up the implementation of long-planned reforms, which have proven painful. A monetary overhaul this year sent inflation soaring four or fivefold, according to economists. Havana has dollarized much of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or who did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy. ""The party congress is taking place in one of the most complex situations the revolution has had,"" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny. Social reforms Raul Castro took after inheriting the party leadership from his brother Fidel in 2008, in particular the expansion of internet on the island, have opened up society. Cubans are increasingly expressing criticism on social media while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media. Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide. ""You cannot only control with repression, you need prosperity and hope,"" said Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, 33, a dissident artist who has become one of the best known faces of an 'artivist' movement challenging the government, partly through performances. Diaz-Canel, a party loyalist who already inherited the presidency from Raul Castro in 2018, has been careful to underscore the continuity of policy throughout the transition, dubbing this weekend's party meeting the ""congress of continuity."" Yet he will have to prove himself, in particular in terms of improving the economy, to retain popular support, say analysts. Cuba experts will carefully scrutinize other senior party appointments to assess whether Diaz-Canel will have backing to speed up the reforms - decentralization, autonomy for state companies, and reducing bureaucracy for private firms - demanded by economists.

5,https://www.firstpost.com/world/castro-era-in-cuba-to-send-as-raul-confirms-hes-retiring-9538111.html,"By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta HAVANA (Reuters) -Raul Castro confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the all-powerful Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress that kicked off on Friday, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel. In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said the new leadership were party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were 'full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit.' Castro had said at the last party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the 'historic generation' who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a U.S.-backed dictator in the 1959 leftist revolution By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta HAVANA (Reuters) -Raul Castro confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the all-powerful Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress that kicked off on Friday, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel. In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said the new leadership were party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit."" Castro had said at the last party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the ""historic generation"" who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a U.S.-backed dictator in the 1959 leftist revolution. He already handed over the presidency to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, in 2018. The congress is the party's most important meeting, held every five years to review policy and fix leadership. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana. The congress is a closed-door event but excerpts are being broadcast on state television. Castro, who launched a raft of social and economic reforms to open up Cuba after inheriting the leadership from Fidel in 2008, hailed Diaz-Canel as one of the new generation of leaders. Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege, who is widely expected to succeed him as party first secretary, the most powerful position in Cuba's one-party system. Older Cubans said they would miss having a Castro at the helm, although most acknowledged it was time to pass on the baton. ""It's another stage,"" said Maria del Carmen Jimenez, a 72-year old retired nurse, ""but without a double we will miss him."" Castro denounced renewed U.S. hostility under former President Donald Trump. Incumbent President Joe Biden has vowed to roll back some of Trump's sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities. Castro said Cuba was ready for a ""new type of relationship with the United States without... Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism."" PRESSURE TO REFORM Cuba's new leaders face the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, while there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans. A tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in the ailing centrally planned economy, which was already struggling following a decline in Venezuelan aid. That has led to shortages of even basic goods, with many Cubans spending hours lining up to buy groceries. Those problems are foremost on citizens' minds, especially younger Cubans who have known only crisis, analysts said. ""I wish for a better future without so many internal and external restrictions,"" said Havana resident Guillermo Estrada, 31. Since the expansion of internet access in recent years, Cubans are increasingly using social media as a platform to express criticism, while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media. Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide. The dire economic situation has pushed the government to speed up the implementation of reforms first agreed by the party in 2011. A monetary overhaul this year sent inflation soaring four or fivefold, according to economists. Havana has dollarized parts of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or who did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy. Castro said on Friday it was important to speed up reforms, denouncing - as he has in the past - ""inertia, conformism, the lack of initiative"" in state companies. Yet he said reforms fomenting the non-state sector should not go beyond certain limits that would lead to the ""very destruction of socialism and the end of national sovereignty."" Party militants like Rogelio Machado, a mathematics teacher, say they were confident the new generation was up to walking that tricky tightrope. ""Our country need changes and the new generation is more scientifically prepared to continue the path of socialism,"" he said. But government critics like ""artivist"" Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom Havana accuses of being part of a U.S.-backed soft coup attempt, say the death knell is sounding for the revolution. ""Raul is passing over the power to someone with little charisma and who does not have much popular support,"" he said while staging his latest performance against the government, in which he sits in a garrote for the four days of the congress. ""This takes us one step closer to democracy.""

Llerena, a New Jersey contractor, escaped the Communist island as part of a mass migration of Cubans known as the Mariel boat lift in 1980, when Rauls brother Fidel Castro was at the helm. ""Were happy. Weve been waiting for it,"" said Llerena, 61, who was playing rummy with friends at the Jose Marti Park in Union City. The park features a bronze bust of the 19th century Cuban poet and patriot, who lived in exile in New York from 1880 until he returned to fight against Spanish imperialism in Cuba, where he died in 1895. Like Marti, Llerena originally moved to New York City from Havana. Llerena has lived in New Jersey since 1982, he said. Dubbed Havana on the Hudson, Union City and West New York have been home to a small Cuban community since the 1940s. Raul Castro gives a speech in 2019. Yamil Lage/Pool via Reuters Although Raul Castro, 89, stepped down from his leadership of the islands ruling Communist Party, little will change on the island, Llerena said. ""Every single one whos got to do with the communist party has got to go,"" said Llerena. ""All the remaining people alive, they have to pay for all the crimes of the past 61 years.""

Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images After serving two terms as Cubas president, Raul Castro stepped down in 2018, allowing his handpicked successor Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez to assume the presidency. In 2008, Raul Castro took over Cubas leadership from his older brother Fidel Castro, the revolutionary leader who had ruled the island since toppling the regime of Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Fidel Castro died in 2016. Although Diaz-Canel is part of a younger generation of politicians on the island, he is serving at the behest of Raul Castro and is unlikely to make sweeping changes on the island, other Cuban American critics told The Post. Raul Castro announced his resignation on April 16, 2021. Ariel Ley/ACN/AFP via Getty Images ""They talk a good talk but I dont see any difference,"" said Tony, 52, a first-generation Cuban American who runs La Pola, his familys Cuban restaurant in West New York. In 2018, a Food Network critic called the restaurants Cuban sandwich the best in the US, sparking a feud with other Cuban communities in Florida. ""Its just one for passing the torch to another,"" said Tony about the handover of power on the island. Diaz-Canel will likely be elected as the secretary general of the Communist Party during this weekends party congress. Both the presidency and head of the party have been traditionally held by the same leader in the country.","['Ben Brachfeld', 'Yamil Lage Afp Via Getty Images', 'Carlos Garcia Rawlins Reuters', 'Social Links For Ben Brachfeld', 'Social Links For Isabel Vincent', 'Contact The Author']",4/17/2021 22:05,Cuban Americans 'happy' to see end of Castro dynasty,"['party', 'end', 'americans', 'llerena', 'leader', 'communist', 'cuban', 'castro', 'dynasty', 'raul', 'island', 'fidel', 'york', 'happy']","When Raul Castro announced the end of his family dynastys grip on power in Cuba, Horacio Llerena was happy to see him go.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, April 18 (Reuters) - Cuban dissidents accused authorities of cutting their web access and preventing them from leaving their homes during the Cuban Communist Party Congress where leaders denounced renewed U.S.-backed attempts at ""counterrevolution"" using online platforms. The four-day congress, where Raul Castro is set to step down as Communist Party leader, takes place amid a dire economic crisis that has fueled social discontent. U.S. sanctions and the pandemic have exacerbated the woes of the ailing state-run economy. The rollout of the internet has also provided new platforms for Cubans to express their frustrations in a one party system which tightly controls public spaces and boosted the growth of non-state media challenging a state monopoly of mass media. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register loading During a speech opening the congress on Friday, Castro warned the ""counterrevolution"" lacked popular support or leadership but was adept at manipulating the web. ""We are firmly convinced the streets, parks and squares belong to the revolutionaries and we will never deny our heroic people the right to defend its revolution,"" said Castro. The U.S. State Department has declined to directly address a Reuters' question about Havana's view that Washington and U.S. groups finance dissidents in a bid to destabilize it. ""We support those in civil society, in Cuba and around the world, who are defending their rights or struggling for freedom,"" a State Department spokesperson said earlier this month. So-called ""acts of repudiation"" when mobs of pro-government supporters show up to harass dissidents have made a comeback in Havana lately after years in which they were not deployed. Castro said counterrevolutionary groups were seeking to infiltrate and manipulate specific groups like the artistic or religious sectors in a bid to break national unity. The party passed a resolution on Sunday agreeing to strengthen ""revolutionary activism"" in social networks. Many of those who have denounced state harassment during the congress belong to the dissident artist collective the San Isidro Movement and 27N, a group of artists, thinkers and journalists which arose from a rare protest of several hundred people outside the culture ministry on Nov. 27. Both call for greater civil liberties and are the fresh face of the Cuban opposition in a country which is proud of its rich arts scene and where traditional political opposition groups have struggled to gain ground. ""State security rang us up to say they would not let anyone leave their homes during the congress, not even to put out the rubbish,"" 27N member and globally renowned performance artist Tania Bruguera told Reuters by telephone. ""They also cut internet for some of us."" Cuban authorities do not comment on police activity such as the detention of dissidents. Bruguera said she and other members of ""27N"" had been on and off prevented from leaving their homes and subjected to brief detentions and interrogations ever since the group's formation. State television has done programs on many attacking them. ""That Raul is retiring does not mean there will be change,"" said Bruguera who six years ago created an Institute of Artivisim in Havana, of the congress, which the party dubbed the ""congress of continuity"". ""Castro goes but Castrism stays"" read an editorial in the non-state online media outlet 14ymedio. The San Isidro Movement said one of their most prominent members Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara was detained overnight on Friday and his artworks seized from his home. He had been staging a performance in which he planned to sit in a garrote during the congress to denounce repression. Fellow MSI member and poet Amaury Pacheco told Reuters by phone he was also briefly detained when he tried to leave his house in protest at the seizure of Otero Alcantara's works. ""They don't want any raised voice or embarrassment during these four days,"" said Pacheco.

8,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/americas/cuba-castro.html,"Over the past few years, as the Trump administration imposed stringent sanctions on Cuba and the tourism industry was decimated by the pandemic, Cubans have seen their countrys economy plummet once again, with many waiting for hours in bread lines. The countrys lauded health care system is frayed. And the number of Cubans trying to leave the island is going up, though it is still far from the exoduses of the 1980s and 1990s. ""The Communist Party lives off the achievements of a long time ago, from when they began,"" said Claudia Genlui, an activist with the San Isidro political movement, a collective of artists who have protested against the Communist Party in recent months. Although the group is small, it has surprised the nation with its continued defiance. ""The party does not represent my generation, it does not represent me,"" Ms. Genlui said, adding that ""there is a lack of generational connection, of interests, of priorities, and all of that somehow drives us away."" Mr. Castro, to some extent, would agree. Although Fidel held fast to his rallying cry of ""socialism or death"" until he died in 2016, the younger Mr. Castro grew to realize that reform was necessary to quell growing discontent and began opening up the countrys economy. After Fidel formally resigned from the presidency in 2008, Raul Castro prioritized recruiting younger Cubans into the Communist Party and putting younger members into top government positions. On Monday, the party held elections for its 17-member Politburo, selecting younger members to the body to replace the last of what Cubans call the ""historics,"" veterans of the armed revolution. That has sat well with some Cubans. ""I think weve got to move on to a new generation, younger people with new ideas,"" said Osvaldo Reyes, 55, a taxi driver in Havana, while voicing his support for Mr. Castro and the Communist Party. ""A revolution should keep transforming, keep doing the best for people.""","['Maria Abi-Habib', 'Ed Augustin']",4/19/2021 7:00,A Cuba Without a Castro?

9,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-president-diaz-canel-made-communist-party-leader-ending-castro-era-2021-04-19/,"HAVANA, April 19 (Reuters) - Cuba turned the page on the Castro era on Monday with the ruling Communist Party electing President Miguel Diaz-Canel to replace Raul Castro as party chief although he said he would continue to consult his predecessor on strategic decisions. The succession marks the end of six decades of rule by brothers Fidel and Raul Castro, who led a 1959 revolution in the Caribbean island nation of 11 million, installing a Communist-run country on the doorstep of the United States. The mantle now passes, in a carefully orchestrated transition, to a younger generation that worked its way up the party ranks rather than forging itself through guerrilla warfare. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Diaz-Canel, 60, who was party chief in two provinces before joining the national government in 2009, had already succeeded Castro, 89, as president in 2018, and been widely tipped to also take the role of first party secretary - the most powerful position in the country. His election came as part of a broader reshuffle of the party's political bureau at a four-day congress held largely behind closed doors under the banner of ""Unity and Continuity"". ""Comrade Raul ... will be consulted on the most important strategic decisions of greatest weight for the destiny of our nation. He will always be present,"" Diaz-Canel told hundreds of delegates in his first speech as party chief, his dark suit and red tie contrasting with Castro's military fatigues. Castro would also continue to dispense guidance and ""alerts in the face of any error or deficiency,"" he said. The reshuffle of the political bureau, the party's highest decision-making body in between sessions of the broader central committee, includes the appointment of Brigadier-General Luis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez-Calleja, head of the armed forces' enterprises which control swathes of the economy. The United States placed Lopez-Calleja, once married to Raul Castro's daughter Deborah, under sanctions late last year. Some Havana residents applauded the generational handover saying Diaz-Canel was more in tune with the times. Others were sceptical it would make much of a difference. ""The only thing that will happen is the Castros will go, but things will continue the same,"" said nurse Melanie Miranda, 22. WARNING SHOT Diaz-Canel has emphasized continuity since becoming president and is not expected to move Cuba away from its one-party socialist system, although he will be under pressure to undertake economic reforms. New U.S. sanctions and the pandemic have exacerbated the woes of Cuba's already ailing centrally planned economy, with widespread shortages of even basic goods spawning multi-hour lines outside stores across the country. Diaz-Canel said on Monday the economy had shown itself to be durable. Cuba had preserved social achievements - like universal healthcare and education - while showing solidarity with other countries during the pandemic, sending them doctors, he said. He also sent a warning shot to opposition activists, in the wake of a growing movement of dissident artists and journalists who have been staging provocative performances or small protests. Dissent has been strengthened by the rollout of the internet, giving Cubans more platforms to express their frustrations in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. Cuba calls the dissident artists part of a new onslaught of U.S.-backed soft coup attempts. They have denounced state security preventing them leaving their homes or cutting their internet and telephone lines during the congress to silence their voices. ""Those lumpen mercenaries who make money on the back of the destiny of all, those who call for invasion, those who continuously offend in words and acts ... would be well advised that this people's patience has limits,"" he said. NEW POLITBURO Castro said at the 2016 congress that it would be the last presided over by the so-called historic generation of those who fought in the Sierra Maestra to overthrow U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. The new policy-setting Political Bureau will not include Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, 90, and Ramiro Valdes, 88, two other famous members of that generation. The party did not replace Machado Ventura, a hardline communist ideologue, as deputy party leader. Valdes will remain a deputy prime minister. The only person from the historic generation to remain on the 14-member bureau is Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera, 77, who fought in the revolution as an adolescent. Cuban podcaster Camilo Condis criticized the committee for not representing the diversity of Cuba's increasingly heterogeneous society. ""There are no artists, who have had so much prominence in Cuban politics in recent months, and no self-employed Cubans who now represent more than 10% of the workforce and have few spaces to be listened to,"" he said. Cuba expert William LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University, said the biggest challenge facing Cuba's new leaders now was economic. ""If the government and the party cannot get the economy growing, they will face real political peril,"" he said.

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) HAVANA (AP) -- If you dont have potato, use malanga root. If you cant find zucchini, replace it with cucumber. Cant find the ingredients you want? No problem: Yuliet Colon will help you whip up a dessert using the eggs you ran across, swap pork for the ground chicken in that recipe, even peanuts for beans in your Cuban-style rice. Shes among a number of Cubans who, with more ingenuity than resources, help their compatriots cope with shortages exacerbated by the new coronavirus pandemic with Facebook posts of culinary creations designed around what theyre actually likely to find at the market or with government rations. ADVERTISEMENT ""I love Master Chef Spain, but where do I get liquid nitrogen in this country?"" joked Colon, a 39-year-old mother of two and one of the creators of the Facebook page, ""Recipes from the Heart."" The site, launched in June, how has more than 12,000 members -- many of them on an island just becoming accustomed to social media due to recently improved internet access. The combination of COVID-19, which shut off income from tourism on the island, local economic productivity woes and sharpened U.S. sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump has led to increased scarcities in Cuba, where gross domestic product decreased by 11% in 2020. Long queues became noticeable last year, and 2021 opened with government economic reforms that effectively raised both prices and pay -- though not always at the same rate. Colon last week visited an agricultural market near her house and, after standing in lines for about 40 minutes, bought the few vegetables she found. She used them to create something that she called ""Cuban-style pisto manchego"" which includes onion, peppers, tomato, eggplant and cucumber -- winning admiring comments from other group members. These days, Cuban household staples come and go without warning. When toothpaste appears, deodorant disappears, and when it returns, soap and the toilet paper have vanished. The same is true for rice, beans, milk, cheese, onions, tomato and or garlic. Fruit has not been seen for weeks. Sometimes potato disappears, prompting Cubans to turn to other tubers popular in the region, yuca or rough-skinned malanga. The Facebook site has become a home for proposals on how to chicken when its the only meat available or create artisanal cheeses with others arent available. ""There are a lot of shortages"", lamented Colon in the small kitchen of her house while she prepared her ""pisto manchego,"" chopping the vegetables and photographing the process before uploading the images. ADVERTISEMENT She added a bit of fresh basil and oregano she took from a small flowerbed that a relative grows at the side of her house. ""What I like the most is making desserts, but now its hard to get eggs, milk or flour,"" Colon said. The Facebook page is an internet-era democratization of earlier efforts to help Cubans make due in hard times, notably following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which devastated the economy of its Caribbean ally in the early 1990s. A TV cooking show at that time once offered suggestions for cooking grapefruit rind steaks. Thanks to arrival of internet access, services to manage food or deliver merchandise have proliferated and relatives abroad can even directly pay telephone bills for those on the island. Cubans can share tips on WhatsApp or Twitter about which stores are stocked with which products. Theyve also helped make authorities more accountable in some cases -- as when a state factory distributed croquettes that cooks complained seemed to explode when put in oil and authorities responded with explanations in the local press. Colon relies on the internet to communicate with her mother, whose deposits help pay for web access that keeps her on Facebook. Colon usually adds a few family anecdotes in her posts. ""The kitchen is my happy place, where I am calmer and I feel better,"" she said.",['Andrea Rodriguez'],4/20/2021 8:27,Cuban cooks overcome shortages with ingenuity on Facebook,"['theyre', 'facebook', 'colón', 'resources', 'market', 'cuban', 'help', 'turn', 'shortages', 'cubans', 'cooks', 'colon', 'ingenuity', 'overcome']","Yuliet Colon, center in tank top, waits her turn outside an agricultural market in Havana, Cuba, Friday, April 2, 2021.

11,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cubas-raul-castro-confirms-stepping-head-communist-party-rcna689,"Raul Castro confirmed Friday he is stepping down as the head of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most powerful position on the island. During a speech on the first day of the Communist Party's eighth congress, he said he would hand over power to a younger generation that is ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit."" ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live, I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told party delegates at the closed-door meeting at a convention center in Havana. He was retiring, Castro said, with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland."" Though there are few expectations of significant change among Cubans, it is however a historic move -- Castro and his late brother, Fidel Castro, have been in power since the 1959 revolution. Though Castro did not name his successor during the speech, it's expected that a subsequent vote will ratify President Miguel Diaz-Canel as the next party secretary-general and set policy guidelines. Raul Castro had said in 2018 he expected Diaz-Canel to replace him after his retirement in 2021. Diaz-Canel, 60, represents a new generation and is serving the first of two five-year terms as president. Many analysts believe Castro, who turns 90 in June, will continue to be the most influential figure on the island until his death. In Cuba, major events are put together during historic celebrations and this years congress is no exception. It coincides with the 60th anniversary of the failed, CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion. Castros retirement comes as Cuba, one of the last communist run-countries in the world, is facing multiple challenges. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, and it's been grappling with tightened U.S. sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally, Venezuela. The government lacks hard currency to import food and medicine, which means endless lines outside stores when food becomes available, and one meal a day for some families. The country is also dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Strict lockdowns and measures have kept the numbers of cases and deaths below those of most countries in the region, but they have also tested the patience of many Cubans. Cuba has developed five vaccine candidates and two are in late-stage trials. The countrys challenges have led to public discontent at levels rarely seen since the 1959 communist revolution. Mobile internet has allowed videos of protests to quickly spread among Cubans and also helped activists mobilize. A large protest in November by artists demanding greater freedom of expression made headlines across the globe. President Joe Biden campaigned on reversing some of the previous administrations harsh measures, such as limits on remittances and restricted travel to the island by Americans while focusing on human rights. But so far, administration officials have indicated they wont be making changes anytime soon. Juan Gonzalez, executive director of the National Security Council, said recently that the ""political moment"" has changed from the Obama administration years and that ""oppression against Cubans is worse today than perhaps during the Bush years."" Disenchantment in the island over the countrys centrally planned system, stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure has been brewing for years, especially among younger Cubans. During the Communist Partys congress in 2011, a set of ambitious economic reforms were promised that have not been fully implemented. Fidel Castro and Raul Castro wave during the annual May Day parade in Revolution Plaza in Havana, May 1, 1973. Cristoval Pascual / AP Victoria Hernandez 37, an entrepreneur who sells products such as hangers and batteries in East Havana, says she does not expect much from the congress. ""I think our officials should change their mentality more to improve things. Right now what were thinking about is food. I want to also think about having a car, a better house,"" she said. Need for economic reform But some experts believe Castro's move is important in order to speed up economic reforms. This involves strategic decisions in order to keep the public more content without ceding the tight grip the party has over society. Arturo Lopez-Levy, a professor at Holy Names University in California, thinks the economic reforms will gain traction once the pandemic is under control. ""What is happening now is a new generation is consolidating control,"" he said. ""Now they will be forced to make important reforms, because their legitimacy doesn't come from a revolutionary background, but from being capable of showing better performance."" He said there arent high expectations among Cubans because the country ""will remain a Leninist system and that basically means the political monopoly of the Communist Party."" Fabio Fernandez, a history professor at the University of Havana, often quoted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, says its important for the party to move forward, fulfill the economic reforms it promised over a decade ago, and make political changes without abandoning its socialist system. ""A new concept of Cuban socialism is what we need to adopt because the old one no longer works,"" he said.

After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Sanchez ended up in a detention center facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) MIAMI (AP) -- After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba. Since the end of the Obama administration, the number of Cubans deported from the U.S. has increased more than tenfold to more than 800 in the past year as the Trump administration enforces a new policy inked just days before it took over. It is also imposing its own sharp limits on who is eligible for asylum. Thats an unwelcome development for growing numbers of asylum-seeking Cubans who had long benefited from a generous U.S. approach and their governments unwillingness to take its people back. ADVERTISEMENT For decades, Cubans fleeing the communist-governed island had for the most part enjoyed unique privileges. Even after the cold war ended, they were given a certain path to legal residence once they touched U.S. soil through the policy known as ""wet foot, dry foot."" But an agreement reached during the final days of the Obama administration ended that and required Cuba to take back citizens who receive deportation orders going forward and consider on a case-by-case basis the return of the thousands of other Cubans who had received such orders over the decades but remained in the U.S. because their country wouldnt take them back. Since Trump took office, more Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border have encountered new limits, including a policy introduced last month that denies protection to asylum seekers who have passed through another country before reaching Mexico and have not sought asylum there. Despite the new agreement, Cuba remains reluctant to take its people back, and is one of 10 countries that the U.S. government labels ""recalcitrant."" That makes it difficult for the administration to enforce its aggressive measures against asylum -- and leaves many Cubans in limbo. Many, like Sanchez, are baffled by their predicament. Sanchez is married to Barbara Rodriguez, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Miami, but was unable to apply for a visa in Cuba to join his wife in the U.S. because the Trump administration pulled most of its embassy staff out, outsourcing family-related visa petitions to consular services in Colombia or Guyana. Rodriguez claims Sanchez was facing increasing political persecution after having brushes with local authorities over such episodes as damaging a referendum ballot as a sign of protest. ADVERTISEMENT The couple agreed he had to get out of Cuba, saying they had learned he was being investigated and could face jail time. Feeling they had no time to waste -- and with no visa services available in Cuba -- Sanchez traveled to Nicaragua and through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S., at a port of entry where authorities detained him and later sent him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for long-term custody. ""This is plain cruel, despite arriving in this country and demonstrating that you are persecuted and that you have credible fear. After all, this gets thrown away,"" said his wife, Rodriguez, who talks to Sanchez on the phone daily. ""The worse thing is that now I feel all that is left for him is deportation."" It is unclear how the Cuban government treats people who are deported from the U.S., but rights advocates and lawyers say they could face retaliation for claiming asylum, especially those who claimed they were being persecuted. By contrast, deportees to Mexico and Central American countries typically get a warm welcome home. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla told The Associated Press the increase in deportations stems from the country ""diligently fulfilling its commitments"" outlined in the accord with the Obama administration, but at the same time he blasted the U.S. for cutting consular services in Havana. ""It is a shame to politicize the human bond between people and between nations,"" he said. A chartered U.S. government flight landed in Havana on Sept. 27 with 96 Cubans aboard, and another with 120 arrived Aug. 30. U.S. officials say Cubas acceptance of this limited number of deportees is a small step, but they believe the nation is still largely unwilling to work with the U.S. on repatriations. They note 39,243 Cubans living in the U.S. with deportation orders. ""Cuba is kind of a thorn in their side in this area,"" said Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Cuba remains on a U.S. government list of ""recalcitrant"" nations with nine other countries: China, Vietnam, Iran, Bhutan, Cambodia, Eritrea, Hong Kong, Laos and Pakistan. About 21,000 Cubans have presented themselves to officials at U.S.-Mexico crossings since last October, triple the number seen the previous 12 months, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics. Thousands more Cubans have been stranded in northern Mexico cities on wait lists to request asylum and through a program that forces migrants to wait south of the border for their asylum cases to play out. Of the Cubans who have been allowed into the U.S., many have been released from custody while they await court dates for their asylum cases, but hundreds have been turned over to ICE custody. About 5,000 Cubans have received deportation orders since the new U.S.-Cuba agreement, and 1,300 of them have been deported, according to ICE data. Luis Dayan Palmero left Cuba in April, traveling from Guyana to Brazil and Colombia, before passing through Central America and arriving in northern Mexico in August. He crossed the Rio Grande and surrendered to Border Patrol agents, who sent him to Matamoros, Mexico. He now has a U.S. court appearing set this month. ""I plan to ask for asylum, and whatever happens is what God wants,"" Palmero said. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein contributed to this story from Havana.","['Adriana Gomez Licon', 'Gisela Salomon']",4/21/2021 6:08,Trump administration ramps up deportations to Cuba,"['mexico', 'asylum', 'deportations', 'ramps', 'cuba', 'deportation', 'cubans', 'rodriguez', 'sanchez', 'trump', 'administration', 'border']","(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)MIAMI (AP) -- After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba.

(U.S. State Department via AP) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Wednesday accused the top U.S. diplomat in the country of working closely with Jose Daniel Ferrer, the detained head of one of the countrys largest opposition groups. The accusations against charge daffaires Mara Tekach were a break from Cubas normal language on U.S. relations, which had remained measured despite an escalating Trump administration campaign to cut off revenue and oil to Cuba. Tekach and the U.S. Embassy in Cuba have tried to foment division among Cubans, ""identifying areas of the economy where they can direct coercive measures, and trying to slander and discredit the performance of the Cuban government and Cuban revolution,"" a Cuban government statement said. The U.S. Embassy in Cuba reopened in 2015 during President Barack Obamas normalization of relations with the island. It has been operating with a skeleton staff since the withdrawal of most personnel in 2017 due to concerns about mysterious health symptoms whose cause has still not been publicly determined. ADVERTISEMENT Ferrer was detained last month on charges that remained unclear until this week. The U.S., opposition groups and human rights organizations demanded his release. Ferrers supporters said that he had been charged with assault and called the case a fabrication. The statement Wednesday in Granma, the Communist Partys official newspaper, said Ferrer was detained Oct. 1 with three other people on suspicion of kidnapping and assaulting another man. It alleged that, since the detention, the United States has used the case in a campaign to discredit Cuba. ""The United States Embassy in Cuba has been the fundamental vehicle for attending to, orienting and financing the conduct of Jose Daniel Ferrer, in a clear demonstration of interference in Cubas internal affairs and open instigation of violence,"" the Cuban statement said. The U.S. says Ferrer is a peaceful dissident whose human rights have been regularly violated by Cuban security forces. Ferrers Patriotic Union of Cuba is perhaps the countrys largest opposition group, with operations based mainly in the east of the island. It sporadically organizes protests against the government, which calls its members mercenaries backed by the U.S. and Cuban exiles overseas.",['Michael Weissenstein'],4/21/2021 12:42,Cuba accuses US diplomat of supporting illegal actions,"['largest', 'diplomat', 'nov', 'ferrer', 'opposition', 'embassy', 'tekach', 'cuban', 'accuses', 'supporting', 'cuba', 'detained', 'statement', 'illegal', 'actions']","1 of 2 This undated photo downloaded from the U.S. Embassy in Cuba website shows Mara Tekach, charge d'affaires for the U.S. Embassy in Cuba.

The current Trump U.S. administration is close to announcing a new policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama, according to a Trump administration official and a person involved in the ongoing policy review. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) HAVANA (AP) -- President Barack Obamas 2014 opening with Cuba helped funnel American travel dollars into military-linked tourism conglomerates even as state security agents waged a fierce crackdown on dissent. The rapprochement also poured hundreds of millions in U.S. spending into privately owned businesses on the island, supercharging the growth of an entrepreneurial middle-class independent of the communist state. It opened a new market for American corporations, with JetBlue and American Airlines operating from gleaming new Havana offices and tens of thousands of private bed-and-breakfasts listed on Airbnb. ADVERTISEMENT Internet access became an affordable reality for hundreds of thousands of Cubans as President Raul Castro met a pledge to Obama and opened nearly 400 public Wi-Fi access points across the country. Meanwhile, longtime enemies separated by 90 miles of ocean struck agreements to cooperate on issues ranging from human trafficking to oil spills. This is the complex scenario facing President Donald Trump as Cuban-American legislators and lobbyists pressure him to fulfill his campaign promise to undo Obamas deal with Cuba. The administration is close to announcing a new policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama, according to a Trump administration official and a person involved in the ongoing policy review. ""As the President has said, the current Cuba policy is a bad deal. It does not do enough to support human rights in Cuba,"" White House spokesman Michael Short said. ""We anticipate an announcement in the coming weeks."" Still under debate: new restrictions on American leisure travel to Cuba, which has more than tripled since Obamas announcement, to nearly 300,000 last year. Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans hate the idea of U.S. travelers enjoying mojitos in the police state that drove exiles from their homes and businesses. Tourism to Cuba remains barred by U.S. law, and American travelers to Cuba still must fall into one of 12 categories of justification for their travel, ranging from religious to educational activities meant to bring the traveler into contact with Cuban people. When Obama took office, ""people-to-people"" travelers could only see the country as part of organized tours -- a measure meant to guarantee that Americans experienced only educational activities such as visits to printing workshops or organic farmers markets. ADVERTISEMENT In reality, the tour requirement guaranteed that American travelers spent virtually every second of their time in Cuba under the direct control of the government, which requires U.S. tour operators to use government tour buses and guides and stay almost entirely in state-run hotels. As his second term came to a close, Obama eliminated that requirement and opened the door for tens of thousands of travelers to book their own independent trips to Cuba. Opponents of Obamas rollback say that has allowed many to engage in prohibited tourism, spending leisure days at the beach and all-inclusive resorts. But individual travel has also served as rocket fuel for Cubas burgeoning private sector. Tens of thousands of Americans are booking direct flights on U.S. airlines to Havana, reserving private lodging through Airbnb and spending thousands of dollars on private guides, taxis and restaurants. A former industrial engineer, 31-year-old Adyarin Ruiz runs a four-bedroom bed-and-breakfast in a restored section of Old Havana thats seeing an increasing number of Americans willing to pay up to $100 a night in a country where state salaries average $25 a month. ""Over the last two years, since relations with the U.S. were restored, Ive seen the growth in American tourism, and even more so since the direct flights started,"" Ruiz said. ""The Americans whove come here are VIPS. You can see that they have money and they appreciate and demand quality, and demand that the house looks really pretty."" There are also now U.S. jobs dependent on travel to Cuba. The American pro-detente group Engage Cuba released a study Thursday asserting that a complete rollback of Obamas Cuba policy would cost airlines and cruise lines $3.5 billion over the next four years and lead to the loss of 10,154 travel jobs. Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss ongoing policy talks say domestic political concerns are the main force driving any rollback on Cuba. During the transition, Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson privately expressed support for Obamas Cuba policy, U.S. officials from the former and current administrations told The Associated Press. The main people still seeking a reversal in the opening are Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, both Cuban-Americans. The Trump government wants to maintain good relations with both Rubio, who sits on the Senate committee investigating Trumps relations with Russia, and Diaz-Balart, a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. Some top Trump advisers also believe that a 2020 re-election victory will rest on keeping the loyalty of Cuban-Americans in Florida whom they see as essential to winning the critical swing state. Many object to the Cuban government seeing any benefit from relations with the U.S., opposed to thousands of American travelers staying in hotels run by GAESA, an increasingly powerful business conglomerate with deep military ties. Cuban-Americans have been particularly offended by Obama allowing U.S. companies to deal directly with military-linked companies, most prominently in an agreement for Stamford, Connecticut-based Starwood to manage at least two Havana hotels. Anti-Castro forces have also been demanding action on human rights: arrests and short-term detentions of protesters climbed from 8,899 in 2014 to 9,940 last year. Cuban officials say many of those arrests are deliberately provoked by dissidents who are funded and backed by anti-Castro groups with the deliberate objective of driving up detention statistics. But the officials say theres another reason to tighten Americas Cuba policy: pressuring Venezuela. The Trump administration has been looking for ways to force Venezuela to address the near-daily protests and violence trying to shake President Nicolas Maduros iron grip on power. Cuba is Maduros close ally and supporter and measures against the Cuban military would send at least the appearance that the U.S. is taking action. Meanwhile, Cuba is preparing for its own transition. Castro is planning to leave Cubas presidency in February 2018 and is expected to hand the role to a 57-year-old vice president who has said little about his vision for the country. Rubios office described the senators goals as laying the groundwork for a new generation of Cuban leaders to empower ordinary citizens of the island. ""I am confident the President will keep his commitment on Cuba policy by making changes that are targeted and strategic and which advance the Cuban peoples aspirations for economic and political liberty,"" Rubio said in a statement released by his office Thursday. _________ Weissenstein reported from Havana and Miami.

15,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/northamerica/2021-04/26/c_139907222.htm,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-04-26 14:30:40|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- With massive car and bicycle caravans across the country, and a regatta along the capital of Havana's seaside Malecon, Cubans demanded on Sunday the lifting of a six-decade-old U.S. embargo against the island, known as blockade among locals. In Santa Clara, located some 270 km east of Havana, hundreds of masked drivers, cyclists and bikers also gathered to make their way through the city. ""It is a clear demonstration the Cuban people support the socialist revolution and that the U.S. blockade against the country must end,"" Santa Clara resident Diamela Lopez told Xinhua. ""The U.S. administration has sanctioned many foreign companies for trading with Cuba,"" he added. Chanting patriotic slogans, blaring horns, and holding national flags, the participants finally reached the Che Guevara Mausoleum in the city. Leonardo Fernandez, a 25-year-old medical student from Santa Clara, said that the U.S. embargo continues to harm the living standards of the Cuban people. ""The blockade has hindered Cuba's access to medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he told Xinhua. ""The U.S. unilateral policy towards the island affects our health system, our public transport network, and the society as a whole."" Meanwhile, hundreds of people also participated in car and bicycle caravans against the embargo in Cuban cities, including Las Tunas, Baracoa, and Nueva Gerona. In addition, some 40 yachts took part in an international regatta that navigated along Havana's coastline while locals flooded social media with pictures taken from balconies and rooftops. It is part of a world initiative in solidarity with the Cuban people, which has taken place over the weekend in more than 50 countries, according to organizers. Earlier this week, Diosvany Acosta, first secretary of Cuba's Young Communist League, said that all voices and energies must be made to stand up against the U.S. embargo. ""The consequences of the U.S. blockade affect all of us, and before such a crime we must not remain in silence,"" he said on social media. The Cuban government announced that it would present its annual draft resolution against the embargo before the UN General Assembly on June 23, which was postponed last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. First imposed in 1962, the embargo was intensified by former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which banned U.S. flights to Cuban cities except for Havana, barred U.S. cruise ships and yachts from visiting the Caribbean nation, and limited remittances that Cuban-Americans sent to their families on the island.

16,https://apnews.com/33d21df8f7de4d34b3fd0b26659b9ea8/'Tear-down-this-firewall'---US-looks-to-expand-Cuba-internet,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new U.S. task force ordered by President Donald Trump warned Wednesday that Cubas government uses internet restrictions to stifle dissent and vowed to find ways the United States could expand access and freedom for Cubans online. The Cuba Internet Task Force held its first public meeting over the objections of Cuban President Raul Castros government, which has dismissed it as an exercise in attempted subversion by Washington. The task force forms part of Trumps tougher approach to Cuba and partial rollback of former President Barack Obamas diplomatic opening with the island. ADVERTISEMENT ""Mr. Castro, tear down this firewall,"" declared Andre Mendes, acting director of the Broadcasting Board of Governors Office of Cuba Broadcasting, in a high-tech twist on former President Ronald Reagans famed admonition to former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Although the task forces narrow mandate is to develop recommendations for how the U.S. could expand internet access in Cuba, the meeting quickly took on clear political undertones, ever-present in Americas long and emotional debate about its policy toward the communist-run island 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Florida. Under fluorescent lighting in a sparse, basement conference room at the State Department, several Cuban dissidents used a public comment period to lambast Cubas government, drawing comparisons to World War II and to the governments of Syria and Iran. Yet most of the public comments centered on a critique of a decades-old economic embargo and Trumps policy toward Cuba. Some argued that any U.S. efforts would backfire, by undermining the perceived independence and credibility of burgeoning independent media in Cuba. Created under a directive from Trump last June, the task force includes senior officials from the State Department, the Commerce Department, the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Agency for International Development. It has no budget, but set a goal to deliver its report on recommendations to Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by February 2019. John Creamer, the deputy assistant secretary of state, said estimates show internet penetration in Cuba is between 5 percent and 40 percent, with the higher figure including those who only can access government-run internet. He said the $1 per hour cost for wi-fi is onerous considering the average salary of roughly $30 per month. For internet access at home, Cubans must pay $17 to $80 per month, depending on speed, for only 30 hours of connectivity, Creamer said. ADVERTISEMENT He said Cubas government ""filters and blocks websites"" in a bid to impede the Cuban peoples ability to criticize government institutions and policies. ""Such acts of aggression have a chilling effect on the exercise of the fundamental freedom of expression,"" Creamer said. Internet access in Cuba, once rare and prohibitively expensive, has spread dramatically and dropped in price since Obama and Castros 2014 deal to normalize relations. There are 508 public WiFi access points across the country and Cuba has begun providing home internet access in cities across the country. The government also says it will begin offering mobile internet access this year. The Cuban internet is mostly uncensored. The state does block some sites, particularly those that receive U.S. funding such as the Office of Cuba Broadcastings Marti television network, but those sites channels can be freely accessed through third parties like Facebook and YouTube. Some of the likely recommendations for expanding access are technical. Tom Sullivan, chief of the FCCs international bureau, said there are no direct, undersea cables between the U.S. and Cuba, though he said there appear to be some U.S. satellites providing service in the island. There was no immediate reaction to the meeting from the Cuban Embassy. But ahead of the meeting, Cuba protested the task forces creation through diplomatic notes rejecting ""the goal of manipulating the internet to bring about illegal programs with subversive political ends."" Cubas Foreign Ministry said it ""reiterated the Cuban governments determination to not tolerate any type of subversive activity or interference in its internal affairs."" ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP",['Josh Lederman'],4/29/2021 0:49,'Tear down this firewall' - US looks to expand Cuba internet,"['state', 'president', 'force', 'meeting', 'access', 'task', 'internet', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'firewall', 'public', 'looks', 'expand', 'tear']","The Cuba Internet Task Force held its first public meeting over the objections of Cuban President Raul Castros government, which has dismissed it as an exercise in attempted subversion by Washington.

17,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/29/cuba-is-closing-in-on-covid-19-vaccine-sovereignty,"The island is developing five experimental shots but two have reached final-stage trials. With two domestically produced COVID-19 vaccines in stage-three clinical trials, Cuba is racing towards potentially becoming the first country in Latin America to develop its own shot against the coronavirus. The island of 11 million people, which has been under a strict US trade embargo for decades, is in process of developing five experimental shots, including Soberana 02 and Abdala, which reached final-stage trials last month. The names of the vaccines reveal much about how Cuba sees the national effort. Soberana translates as ""sovereign"", while the Abdala shot was named after a patriotic poem by the Cuban revolutionary hero Jose Marti. Around 44,000 people will receive the Soberana 02 vaccine, and some 48,000 volunteers have been recruited for the Abdala trial. According to local reports, an additional 150,000 frontline workers will also receive the Soberana 02 shot. The Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, which is developing Abdala, is hoping to have ""effective results"" from the trial by early June, while results from the trial of Soberana 02, which is being developed by the Finlay Institute, are expected in May. ""There are already positive preliminary results,"" Ricardo Perez, head of International Relations at the Finlay Vaccine Institute, told Al Jazeera. ""These might allow us to present a dossier to the Cuban authorities that would enable us to request approval for emergency use of the product, not anymore as a candidate but as a product ... probably by the end of next month,"" he said. Health workers are tested after receiving a dose of the Soberana-02 COVID-19 vaccine, as part of stage-three trials of the experimental Cuban vaccine candidate [File: Ramon Espinosa /Reuters] Dr Gerardo Guillen, Director of Biomedical Research at the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, told Al Jazeera that there were high levels of trust among the public in the candidate vaccines. ""Since health is universal and free and the centres do not profit from access to these vaccines, these conditions remove many ethical barriers and create a lot of trust in the centres for research and vaccine production,"" he said. Cuba is hoping to vaccinate all its inhabitants before the end of the year. The Finlay Institute says it can produce 100 million doses of the Soberana 02 vaccine this year. The aim is to satisfy the countrys demand and to be able to export the remaining shots. It is an ambitious goal, but the countrys pharmaceutical and biotech industries have a decades-long history and have produced several vaccines including shots against Hepatitis B and Meningitis B. ""Cuba has been developing vaccines since the 80s, so despite having a poor and dysfunctional economy, the government managed to develop an important technological platform for a small country,"" Cuba economist Ricardo Torres told Al Jazeera. Dr Jose Moya, a representative of the Pan American Health Organization in Cuba, said the island already develops 80 percent of the vaccines that are part of its national immunisation programme. ""Cuba has the capacity to do this,"" Dr Moya told Al Jazeera. ""This is also important for the region since this could [also] open the opportunity to transfer technology within our countries,"" Dr Moya said. A health worker asks questions in a quarantine area amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in Havana, Cuba [File: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] The race to develop vaccines comes as the island struggles with a recent surge of infections. The seven-day average for new infections was more than 1,100 on April 28, according to Our World in Data. Cubas death toll since the pandemic started has reached 614. For much of last year, the country saw extremely low rates of new infections. The spike followed after the government opened borders to international travel in November. However, the number of infections and deaths remains much lower in Cuba than in other parts of the world, where new variants have overwhelmed health systems in several countries. The government did not purchase vaccines from other countries and Cuba did not sign up to the COVAX scheme, a vaccine-sharing initiative backed by the World Health Organization, and developed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi. The government has not commented on the decision to rely on domestic vaccine production. Dr Guillen noted that some countries have experienced problems with vaccine supply chains, and said the US embargo on Cuba made it harder to access some materials. ""Some countries that have already signed contracts have not been able to access the doses they have [bought], due to the lack of availability in vaccines,"" Dr Guillen said. ""In Cuba, the access is more difficult due to the embargo. Therefore we have to rely on our own capabilities and strengths, and that is what weve been doing,"" he added. Cuba is currently struggling with a rise in cases with an average of more than1,100 daily cases [File:Ramon Espinosa/Reuters] The US embargo against Cuba is one of the longest trade embargoes in modern history. Starting in the late 1950s, the embargo prohibits most US companies and individuals from doing business in Cuba. Under the embargo, businesses are not allowed to sell to Cuba any medical product that contains more than 20 percent of American components, and the regulations require an individual license for equipment that has more than 10 percent. During the presidency of Donald Trump, 90 new economic restrictions were imposed in Cuba. These targeted financial transactions, tourism, energy, and foreign investments. The blockade has made it difficult to acquire the raw materials needed to produce the vaccines and to make payments to Cubas international suppliers, Dr Guillen said. ""This is a very strict blockade,"" he said. ""We try to acquire products that dont have the American technology, but sometimes that is very difficult, so then we have to do it through third countries, and many times those countries are also blocked ... the technology for Cuba is blocked,"" he added. However, as the vaccine trials have progressed, the government has talked about sending doses to countries including Venezuela and Iran, where Soberana 02 is also undergoing late-stage trials. Earlier this month Venezuela announced the signing of an agreement with Cuba that would allow them to produce the Abdala vaccine. ""The priority until now has been to develop a vaccine for [Cubas] population,"" Dr Guillen said. ""Cuba has always been open to South-South cooperation, however, our capacity of production is not unlimited, so we will have to discuss with our counterparts, [and find] different ways to address this,"" he added.",['Elizabeth Melimopoulos'],4/29/2021 20:25,Cuba could be closing in on COVID vaccine sovereignty,"['embargo', 'countries', 'vaccines', 'soberana', 'health', 'vaccine', 'covid', 'cuba', 'guillen', '02', 'closing', 'dr', 'sovereignty']","Around 44,000 people will receive the Soberana 02 vaccine, and some 48,000 volunteers have been recruited for the Abdala trial. According to local reports, an additional 150,000 frontline workers will also receive the Soberana 02 shot. The Finlay Institute says it can produce 100 million doses of the Soberana 02 vaccine this year.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, May 1 (Reuters) - For a second consecutive year Communist-run Cuba canceled its emblematic May Day march though Havana's Plaza de la Revolution Square on Saturday as it battles a surge in COVID-19 cases and a scarcity of basic goods. Across the island, small groups of dignitaries gathered at abandoned squares that would usually be filled by crowds of banner-waving citizens marking International Workers Day, the country's most important holiday after Jan. 1, victory day of former leader Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. ""Congratulations workers! It is monumental what has been done to survive the pandemic under a reinforced blockade and still move forward,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is also first secretary of the Communist party, wrote on Twitter. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Cuba's economy shrunk 11% last year under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic, harsh U.S. sanctions and its Soviet-style system. The country has recorded more COVID-19 cases and deaths this year than in all of 2020, though the mortality rate remains among the best in the world and two homegrown vaccines are in final trials. Ulises Guilarte de Nascimiento, head of the official and only trade union federation, said on state-run television on Friday that workers faced layoffs and inflation and some struggled to ""meet their basic needs"". He blamed U.S. sanctions and said hard work and greater efficiency would lead to better days. Speaking on Saturday morning to a small group of national leaders gathered in front of the monument to independence hero Jose Marti in Revolution Square, he was defiant. ""We workers are aware that we are going through a complex and challenging scenario, but we also carry the conviction that Fidel taught us, that only those who fight, resist and do not give up have the right to succeed,"" he said. State-run media urged citizens to turn their homes into squares and share their celebrations on social media. Small groups of workers rallied at some workplaces. People hung flags from balconies and played the national anthem. ""Today is a special day, a sad day, because in all this time of the pandemic we have lost valuable workers,"" Havana resident Enrique Tondique Dominguez said early Saturday at a small rally in front of the Mining and Energy Ministry. ""It is a happy day because it is May Day, but it is also a sad day because many workers are no longer with us,"" he said.

19,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/northamerica/2021-05/31/c_139980397.htm,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-05-31 11:05:46|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- With a symbolic release of about 6,000 pigeons all over the country, the Cubans on Sunday condemned the six-decade U.S. embargo against the island, known as the blockade among locals. In Havana, participants gathered at the National Hotel's gardens, where Cuban flags and patriotic banners in support of the socialist revolution were placed. The event was attended by representatives of the island's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cuban Pigeon Fanciers Federation, and the country's social organizations. ""People who love Cuba stand against the U.S. blockade,"" Andres Carvajal, president of the students' league at the Technological University of Havana, told Xinhua. ""We are sending a peace message,"" he added. The event came as the island nation registered 1,079 new COVID-19 infections and seven related deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the national caseload to 141,166 and death toll to 950. Fermin Quinones, president of the Cuban Association of the United Nations (ACNU), told Xinhua that the U.S. embargo continued to affect the social and economic development of the Caribbean nation. ""It is part of a global initiative in solidarity with the Cuban people, which has taken place in more than 70 countries over the weekend,"" he said. ""We want to raise awareness about the necessity to put an end to the U.S. blockade on Cuba."" Meanwhile, hundreds of people also participated in a car and bicycle caravan against the embargo in the central province of Ciego de Avila. In addition, some 50 yachts took part in a regatta that navigated along the southern Cuban city of Cienfuegos's sea boulevard as dozens of masked people waved from the shore. On June 23, the Cuban government will present its annual draft resolution against the embargo before the UN General Assembly, which was postponed last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a morning tweet, Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez said: ""As the world demands to build bridges of love amid the pandemic, the U.S. government keeps Donald Trump's measures that affect the Cuban people intact."" ""The fight against the COVID-19 (pandemic) is universal, so is the claim against the blockade,"" he added. First imposed in 1962, the U.S. embargo on Cuba was reinforced by former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which adopted more than 240 economic measures against the island. Those measures include banning U.S. flights to Cuban cities except Havana, barring U.S. cruise ships and yachts from visiting the Caribbean nation, and limiting remittances that Cuban Americans send to their families on the island.

20,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/06/04/cuban-dissidents-plan-transition-and-reconstruction-after-communism/,"A coalition of over 20 dissident organizations spanning 11 provinces in Cuba recently held a ""Congress of the Cuban Nation"" to address not just the eradication of communism, but the republic that should replace it, the Assembly for the Cuban Resistance confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday. The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance is a coalition of pro-democracy, human rights groups both on the island and in the diaspora, many of which participated in the Congress of the Cuban Nation. Many of its member groups participated in the discussions. The events - 63 different meetings addressing topics from the reunification of the island population with the Cuban diaspora to the creation of ""joint commissions for the transition and reconstruction"" of the country following 62 years of communism - took place last week. They served as a vision of what a Congress representing all facets of a nation should be, the dissidents contended, in contrast to the Eighth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party, taking place this week. The Communist Party is the only legal party in Cuba and, under the rule of the Castro dictators, has remained in power since President Fulgencio Batista fled the country in 1959. Prior to that date, Cuba functioned as a republic since its founding in 1902. The Party dictates all priorities and investments of the Cuban government and controls the nations entire economy, profiting the most from control of the nations lucrative tourism industry and its slave-doctor network, which the Organization of American States (OAS) has declared a form of human trafficking. Tensions among the general population in Cuba have escalated in the past year as the island has experienced a particularly severe outbreak of Chinese coronavirus after the Communist Party initially welcomed tourists while the rest of the world shut down. Italian tourists were the first people to test positive for Chinese coronavirus on the island, according to government statistics. Exacerbating the problem are densely-populated food ration lines and the use of poorly administered prison camps to isolate suspected coronavirus patients. The Congress of the Cuban Nation differed from prior dissident events in that it attempted to shift the focus of the pro-democracy community away from solely opposing the dictatorship in power and towards solving the mounting list of problems the Cuban people face - proving the Cuban people can govern themselves. The movement towards illicitly exercising the right to self-governance under communism, in addition to protesting the region, is the start of a shift towards liberation events planned for the 120th anniversary of the Republic of Cuba in 2022, according to Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, the director of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance. The Congress also served to shift the movement towards a leaderless, more open structure making it more difficult for the Cuban state to imprison, torture, and silence dissidents, emulating a greater shift towards leaderless anti-authoritarian movements in other communist areas like Belarus and Hong Kong. Many of those in attendance at the dissident Congress also participated in nationwide protests in April calling for the freedom of 47 pro-democracy dissidents in Hong Kong, currently held under charges of violating Chinas illegitimate ""national security"" law. Under the ""one country, two systems"" policy, Beijing has no power to implement laws in Hong Kong, and Hong Kongs detention of dissidents under the national security law is itself illegal. Among the issues on the agenda for the dissident Congress were the longtime repression of labor unions on the island - despite the Communist Party claiming to represent workers; violence against women, of which the state is a significant perpetrator; and a ""national strike"" to paralyze the Communist Party, a form of protest seen more often in Latin America undertaken by leftist labor groups. ""The different sectors active in the Congress made the decision that the only way to achieve social revindication and respect for human rights is taking to the streets to demand them civically,"" documents distributed to all cells of the Congress read in part, urging members to ""work tirelessly to achieve unity among the forces of the resistance organized by parties, movements, unions, professionals, and independent activists throughout the nation."" The documents featured photos of the events and displayed both the flag of the Republic of Cuba and the first flag ever used, in 1868, to represent Cuba as a sovereign nation, at the start of the war of independence against Spain. The ultimate goal, the documents clarified, is the creation of ""a new republic - [to] create a roadmap for transition and reconstruction of the country in all sectors."" The group concluded that its next steps would be the creation of ""joint commissions for the transition and reconstruction [post-communism], based on existing reconstruction proposals within and without Cuba.""

""The Castro dictatorship doesnt want the world to see whats happening,"" Salazar wrote. ""Please SHARE & stand with these freedom fighters!"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called out the mainstream media for refusing to provide extensive coverage on the unrest in Cuba. ""Attention US media ... in #Cuba they are rising up because socialism is (always a) disaster,"" Rubio tweeted. ""Are you going to report on this so the world can hear their voices?"" Rubio then urged President Joe Biden and Secretary Anthony Blinken to call on members of the Cuban military to not fire on their own people. ""The incompetent communist party of #Cuba cannot feed or protest the people from the virus,"" Rubio wrote. ""Now those in the military must defend the people not the communist party."" Rubio also slammed Twitter for suggesting that the mass protests were about raising COVID ""awareness"" in the country."" ""(Twitter) Ignores (that) this is really about how socialism is a disaster & always leads to tyranny, despair & suffering,"" Rubio wrote, sharing a screenshot of ""#SOSCuba"" trending on Twitter. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted that the ""Communist Cuban regime will be consigned to the dustbin of history. It has brutalized & denied freedom to generations of Cubans, and forced my family & so many others to flee. The American people stand squarely with the men & women of Cuba and their noble fight for liberty."" Florida U.S. Reps. Carlos A. Gimenez, Mario Diaz-Balart, and Maria Elvira Salazar, issued a joint statement in support of the protests in Cuba. ""Now more than ever, the United States and the international community must support the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. The humanitarian crisis Cuba faces right now is yet another symptom of the incompetence and absolute cruelty of the Cuban tyranny,"" the statement said. ""We know what freedom means for the Cuban people, and now, while the regime uses savage violence against the people peacefully demonstrating in the streets, the world has the obligation to stand with the brave Cuban people."" Meanwhile, demonstrations of solidarity with the Cuban protesters broke out a Cuban embassy in Argentina, and in Miami, where there is a sizable population of Cuban immigrants and descendants. Gelet Fragela, who runs the Miami-based Cuban news outlet ADN Cuba, told Fox News that the country has been clamping down on its media - including for ADN - for months leading up to the protests. ""Cuba, just like the Soviet Union, is an organized totalitarian regime that creates a false reality and sends that to the world,"" Fragela said.

""I wouldn't say this is a protest because of the lack of COVID vaccines, I think this is a protest for the people of Cuba asking for the regime to end once and for all after more than 60 years of repression,"" Fragela said.

23,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/street-protests-break-out-cuba-2021-07-11/,"HAVANA, July 11 (Reuters) - Chanting ""freedom"" and calling for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down, thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades. The protests erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, its old ally, and a record surge in coronavirus infections, with people voicing anger over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. Thousands took to the streets in various parts of Havana including the historic centre, their shouts of ""Diaz-Canel step down"" drowning out groups of government supporters waving the Cuban flag and chanting ""Fidel."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Special forces jeeps, with machine guns mounted on the back were seen throughout the capital and the police presence was heavy even long after most protesters had gone home by the 9 p.m. curfew in place due to the pandemic. ""We are going through really difficult times,"" Miranda Lazara, 53, a dance teacher, who joined the thousands of protesters who marched through Havana. ""We need a change of system."" Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, blamed the unrest on old Cold War foe the United States, which in recent years tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island, in a televised speech on Sunday afternoon. Diaz-Canel said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and ""mercenaries"" on the ground, and warned that further ""provocations"" would not be tolerated, calling on supporters to confront ""provocations."" The president was due to make another address to the nation at 9 a.m. on Monday, according to state-run media. Julie Chung, acting undersecretary of the U.S. State Department's Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said it was deeply concerned by ""calls to combat"" in Cuba and stood by the Cuban peoples right for peaceful assembly."" Reuters witnesses in Havana protests saw security forces, aided by suspected plain clothes officers, arrest about two dozen protesters. Police used pepper spray and hit some protesters as well as a photographer working for the Associated Press. In one area of Havana, protesters took out their anger on an empty police car, rolling it over and then throwing stones at it. Elsewhere, they chanted ""repressors"" at riot police. Some protesters said they went on to the streets to join in after seeing what was happening on social media, which has become an increasingly important factor since the introduction of mobile internet two and a half years ago, although connections were patchy on Sunday. NATIONWIDE PROTESTS 1/5 People shout slogans against the government during a protest against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Read More The Caribbean island nation of 11 million inhabitants where public dissident is usually restricted has seen a growing number of protests over the past year although nothing on this scale or simultaneously in so many cities. The anti-government demonstrations were the largest since the summer of 1994, said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University. ""Only now, they weren't limited to the capital; they didn't even start there, it seems,"" he said. Sunday's demonstrations broke out at around midday in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana. Video on social media showed hundreds of residents chanting anti-government slogans and demanding everything from coronavirus vaccines to an end of daily blackouts. ""I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,"" resident Claris Ramirez said by phone. ""They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine"". President Diaz-Canel visited the town, later saying in his broadcast remarks: ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations"". There were protests later on Sunday hundreds of miles to the east in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba, where social media video showed hundreds marching through the streets, again confirmed by a resident. ""They are protesting the crisis, that there is no food or medicine, that you have to buy everything at the foreign currency stores, and on and on the list goes,"" the resident, Claudia Perez, said. The protests in Havana started around 3 p.m. and fizzled out around 8 p.m., with some protesters giving up after security forces thwarted their attempt to reach Revolution Square Cuba has been experiencing a worsening economic crisis for two years, which the government blames mainly on U.S. sanctions and the pandemic, while its detractors cite incompetence and a Soviet-style one-party system. A combination of sanctions, inefficiencies and the pandemic has shut down tourism and slowed other foreign revenue flows in a country dependent on them to import the bulk of its food, fuel and inputs for agriculture and manufacturing. The economy contracted 10.9% last year, and 2% through June of 2021. The resulting cash crunch has spawned shortages that have forced Cubans to queue for hours for basic goods throughout the pandemic. Cuba has begun a mass vaccination campaign, with 1.7 million of its 11.2 million residents vaccinated to date and twice that many have received at least one shot in the three-shot process. Still, the arrival of the Delta variant has prompted cases to surge, with health authorities reporting a record 6,923 cases and 47 deaths on Sunday - twice as many as the previous week. Hospitals in the worst affected province have been overwhelmed.

Thousands of people marched through San Antonio de los Banos, southwest of Havana, with videos streaming live on Facebook for nearly an hour before they suddenly disappeared. As the afternoon wore on, other videos appeared from demonstrations elsewhere, including Palma Soriano, in the countrys southeast. Hundreds of people also gathered in Havana, where a heavy police presence preceded their arrival. ""The people are dying of hunger!"" one woman shouted during a protest filmed in the province of Artemisa, in the islands west. ""Our children are dying of hunger!"" One clip circulating on Twitter showed protesters overturning a police car in Cardenas, 90 miles east of Havana. Another video showed people looting from one of the much-detested government-run stores, which sell wildly overpriced items in currencies most Cubans do not possess.",['Frances Robles'],7/11/2021 21:13,Cubans Denounce 'Misery' in Biggest Protests in Decades,"['havana', 'videos', 'showed', 'decades', 'protest', 'nearly', 'dying', 'yearsthousands', 'wore', 'protests', 'cubans', 'woman', 'biggest', 'misery', 'denounce']","Thousands of people marched through San Antonio de los Banos, southwest of Havana, with videos streaming live on Facebook for nearly an hour before they suddenly disappeared.

25,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/americas/cuba-protests/index.html,"Havana, Cuba (CNN) Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. Demonstrators complained about a lack of freedom and the worsening economic situation during the rare protests, according to people who spoke to CNN and videos from multiple cities, including capital Havana. Many chanted for ""freedom"" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down. Multiple protesters were arrested by police, who used tear gas to break up some demonstrations. In Havana, a CNN team witnessed demonstrators being forcibly arrested and thrown into the back of vans by police officers. There were also violent clashes, where protesters turned over a police car and threw rocks at officers. In a nationally televised address, President Diaz-Canel said US trade sanctions had created economic misery on the communist-run island. Diaz-Canel did not offer the protesters any concessions in his speech, but instead urged his supporters to physically confront them. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance, ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets."" In the city of San Antonio de los Banos, just outside Havana province, hundreds of people defied a heavy police presence to air their complaints. One resident who did not wish to be identified told CNN that residents had been enduring power outages for a week and that had ""detonated"" the growing outrage. Social media platforms are being restricted in Cuba, according to internet monitor NetBlocks. NetBlocks tweeted on Monday that ""Social media and messaging platforms restricted in #Cuba from Monday on state-run internet provider ETECSA; real-time network data corroborate reports of internet disruptions amid widening anti-government protests; incident ongoing #CubaSOS."" The NetBlocks website said its metrics showed that WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and some Telegram servers were being disrupted. Videos uploaded to social media showed how the spontaneous protest movement has gained momentum, with streams appearing of other protests in a handful of cities and towns across the island. In some of the videos, people shouted they ""weren't afraid"" or that they wanted liberty or access to coronavirus vaccines. President Diaz-Canel made an unplanned stop in San Antonio de los Banos on Sunday after police had cleared protesters, while Cuban government officials blamed the protests on ""salaried agents"" on Twitter. Calls for restraint On Monday, US President Joe Biden called on the Diaz-Canel government to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also tweeted on Sunday night, ""the U.S. supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights."" Other US officials also urged for restraint, saying Cubans had the right to protest. ""We are deeply concerned by ""calls to combat"" in #Cuba. We stand by the Cuban people's right for peaceful assembly. We call for calm and condemn any violence,"" Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, tweeted Sunday. ""For decades, Cuba's dictatorship has used violence and repression to silence its people, rather than permit the free exercise of democracy and their basic social rights,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez said in a statement. ""This must end. The world's eyes are on Cuba tonight and the dictatorship must understand we will not tolerate the use of brute force to silence the aspirations of the Cuban people,"" he added. Other world leaders have also weighed in, with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro criticizing socialist regimes on the continent. People went on the streets to ask for ""freedom,"" and received ""rubber bullets, beatings, and prison,"" he said. Strained US-Cuba relations But statements from US leaders have prompted angry criticism from Cuban authorities, who argue that US sanctions are the cause of Cuba's ailing economy. US-Cuban relations are at their lowest point in years. The Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, and so far, the Biden administration seems reluctant to lift them The already struggling Cuban economy has been hit hard as tourism and good imports have dropped steeply during the pandemic. On Sunday, Cuban health officials reported a record single-day increase for new Covid-19 cases and deaths President Diaz-Canel criticized the protests, calling demonstrators vandals who ""broke into the stores and stole [many] items."" He pointed to ""restrictive measures"" by the Trump administration that caused ""a very rough period of time, where we were going to have many difficulties and economic scarcities."" Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez also criticized Sullivan's statement on Monday, saying he had ""no political or moral authority to speak about Cuba."" ""His government has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to promote subversion in our country & implements a genocidal blockade, which is the main cause of economic scarcities,"" Rodriguez added in a tweet. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also called on the US to suspend their Cuba trade embargo as a humanitarian gesture. ""No country in the world should be fenced in, blockaded -- that's the opposite of human rights,"" he said. When asked why Biden had not yet reversed Trump's policies towards Cuba, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the US had continued to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies -- but added, ""I have nothing to preview for you in terms of a change of policy."" In a statement on Sunday, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken pushed back against criticisms from the Cuban government, saying ""it would be a grievous mistake for the Cuban regime to interpret what is happening in dozens of towns and cities across the island as the result or product of anything the United States has done."" ""That is what we are hearing and seeing in Cuba, and that is a reflection of the Cuban people, not of the United States or any other outside actor,"" he said.","['Patrick Oppmann', 'Tatiana Arias']",7/11/2021 22:17,Cubans take to streets in rare protests over lack of freedoms and worsening economy,"['cnn', 'streets', 'president', 'freedoms', 'biden', 'cuban', 'protests', 'rare', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'freedom', 'economic', 'lack', 'economy', 'violence', 'worsening', 'protesters']","Havana, Cuba (CNN) Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions.

26,https://www.foxnews.com/world/watch-american-flags-fly-high-in-opposition-of-cubas-communist-government,"A week after America celebrated its independence -- and in the midst of a romanticization of socialist principles from American politicians, celebrities and athletes -- the people of Cuba took to the streets on Sunday to wave American flags high in the air in opposition of their oppressive communist government. In a heartbreaking scene for Americans that have witnessed their media tear down American symbolism and vow to burn flags on a global platform, the people of Cuba -- who experience the torment of living under a communist dictatorship first-hand -- continue to believe that the American flag symbolizes a never-ending promise of opportunity, equality and freedom. Fueled in recent years by the cowardly Colin Kaepernick, preference for communist ideals and redefining American symbols as representations of ""white supremacy"" continues to only grow in popularity among media figures looking to benefit off the dangerous rhetoric -- while citizens under the dictatorship rule continue to be tortured, killed and starved by their government. VIDEO EMERGES OF MASS PROTESTS AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP IN CUBA: 'WE ARE NOT AFRAID According to the Fox News report, the Cuban protesters walked the streets hoisting American flags high and chanting ""we are not afraid."" Watch as OutKicks Clay Travis goes in on Kaepernick, whose net worth of over $20 million couldnt be a better indicator of the oxymoronic politics the washed up QB chooses to promote. ""After Colin Kaepernick decided to not stand for the nation anthem, he met the media immediately thereafter and he was wearing a Fidel Castro t-shirt. If you were in any kind of way intellectually sophisticated about the arguments that you were making, I dont know if the best representative sample of freedom of speech that you can choose is a communist dictator from a country where they still have to drive cars from the 1950s and the 1960s. ""Not only that, Kaepernick then played against the Miami Dolphins and defended, because he was asked about it by a lot of Latin American former refugees from Cuba, all over Venezuela, who have seen the hard hand of socialism face to face, he was asked about it ... and he praised Cuba! As if Cuba were in some way something that the United States should be emulating."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As the video from Cuba reverberates the stance that Clay has defiantly stood for since Kaepernick donned the Dunce cap, the fight to preserve our nations ideals continues to not only affect Americans, but those fighting and dying around the globe to keep the hope of freedom alive. ""So I think what Kaepernick represents, in many ways, is an unsophisticated understanding of the basic tenets of capitalism, of democracy, of history. This is a guy who has decided that hating America makes him a lot of money ... which is an ultimate irony, right?""",[],7/11/2021 22:23,Watch: American flags fly high in opposition of Cuba's communist government,"['kaepernick', 'streets', 'media', 'opposition', 'dictatorship', 'high', 'flags', 'communist', 'way', 'cuba', 'lot', 'cubas', 'american', 'watch', 'fly']","A week after America celebrated its independence -- and in the midst of a romanticization of socialist principles from American politicians, celebrities and athletes -- the people of Cuba took to the streets on Sunday to wave American flags high in the air in opposition of their oppressive communist government.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets in rare anti-government protests in Cuba, where the coronavirus pandemic and an economic crisis are spurring frustrations, with some demonstrators chanting ""down with the dictatorship"" and ""we want liberty."" At a protest on Sunday in San Antonio de los Banos, a town of some 50,000 people southwest of Havana, mainly young people shouted insults against President Miguel Diaz-Canel, according to videos posted online. ""We are not afraid,"" some said. ""I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,"" local resident Claris Ramirez told the Reuters news agency by phone. ""They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine,"" she added. Thousands of people also gathered in downtown Havana and along parts of the seaside drive amid a heavy police presence, while protests took place later in the day in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba. Police drive near people during protests against and in support of the Cuban government, in Havana on July 11 [Stringer/Reuters] The demonstrations came as Cuba is experiencing its toughest phase yet of the coronavirus crisis, and the same day it reported a new daily record of infections and deaths. Social anger has been driven by long food lines and a critical shortage of medicines since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, with Cuba under United States sanctions. Diaz-Canel late on Sunday afternoon addressed the nation, accusing the US of being responsible for the unrest. He warned that further ""provocations"" would not be tolerated. Havana-based journalist Ed Augustin said there was a heavy police presence in the capital. He said Diaz-Canel in his speech to the country called on people who support the Cuban revolution to come out to defend it. ""These are the biggest protests in Cuba for decades,"" Augustin told Al Jazeera. CUBA: Social media videos of rare anti-government protests in various cities amid reports of gas, electricity and vaccine shortages. President Miguel Diaz-Canel responds, calls it a provocation and calls on supporters of the revolution to take to the streets. -- Gabriel Elizondo (@elizondogabriel) July 11, 2021 Washington meanwhile reacted swiftly to the days events. ""The US supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights,"" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Twitter. Cuba was left relatively unscathed in the first months of the coronavirus outbreak, but it has seen a recent increase in infections. A new record of 6,923 daily cases was reported on Sunday, along with 47 additional deaths. ""These are alarming numbers which are increasing daily,"" said Francisco Duran, head of epidemiology in the health ministry. The country has been developing five of its own COVID-19 vaccines and last month said one of them, called Abdalla, showed 92 percent efficiency. Cuban doctors and nurses have been fanning out across the capital in an effort to encourage jabs, hoping inoculations will help stem the rising infection numbers.",[],7/11/2021 22:38,Thousands join rare anti-government protests in Cuba,"['havana', 'videos', 'daily', 'toughest', 'support', 'thousands', 'protests', 'rare', 'join', 'cuba', 'town', 'antigovernment', 'coronavirus', 'told']","Demonstrations come as Cuba is experiencing its toughest phase yet of the coronavirus crisis.

Hundreds of demonstrators went out to the streets in several cities in Cuba to protest against ongoing food shortages and high prices of foodstuffs, amid the new coronavirus crisis. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) HAVANA (AP) -- Thousands of Cubans marched on Havanas Malecon promenade and elsewhere on the island Sunday to protest food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis, in one of biggest anti-government demonstrations in memory. Many young people took part in the afternoon protest in the capital, which disrupted traffic until police moved in after several hours and broke up the march when a few protesters threw rocks. Police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted ""Freedom,"" ""Enough"" and ""Unite."" One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-age protester told The Associated Press. He declined to identify himself for fear of being arrested later. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. ADVERTISEMENT An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sundays demonstrations. ""Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need,"" tweeted Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for Western Hemisphere affairs. Cubas director general for U.S. affairs, Carlos F. de Cossio, dismissed her remarks in his own tweet: ""US State Department and its officials, involved to their necks in promoting social and political instability in #Cuba, should avoid expressing hypocritical concern for a situation they have been betting on. Cuba is and will continue to be a peaceful country, contrary to the US."" The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages. People standing on many balconies along the central artery in the Centro Habana neighborhood applauded the protesters passing by. Others joined in the march. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. ""The people came out to express themselves freely, and they are repressing and beating them,"" Rev. Jorge Luis Gil, a Roman Catholic priest, said while standing at a street corner in Centro Habana. About 300 people close to the government then arrived with a large Cuban flag shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. Some people from the group assaulted an AP videojournalist, disabling his camera, while an AP photojournalist was injured by the police. Demonstrations were also held elsewhere on the island, including the small town of San Antonio de los Banos, where people protested power outages and were visited by President Miguel Diaz-Canel. He entered a few homes, where he took questions from residents. Afterward, though, he accused Cuban of stirring up trouble. ""As if pandemic outbreaks had not existed all over the world, the Cuban-American mafia, paying very well on social networks to influencers and Youtubers, has created a whole campaign ... and has called for demonstrations across the country,"" Diaz-Canel told reporters.",['Andrea Rodriguez'],7/11/2021 22:44,"Demonstrators in Havana protest shortages, rising prices","['prices', 'havana', 'rising', 'protest', 'protester', 'cuban', 'ap', 'crisis', 'cuba', 'shortages', 'coronavirus', 'demonstrators', 'protesters']","Plainclothes police detain an anti-government protester during a protest in Havana, Cuba, Sunday, July 11, 2021.

President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, blamed the United States for the unrest in a nationally televised speech Sunday afternoon. Special forces jeeps with machine guns mounted on the back were seen in Havana, and Diaz-Canel called on supporters to confront ""provocations."" Thousands of people gathered in downtown Havana and along parts of the seaside drive amid a heavy police presence. There were a few arrests and scuffles, but no major confrontations. The protests broke out in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana, with video on social media showing hundreds of residents chanting anti-government slogans and demanding everything from coronavirus vaccines to an end to daily blackouts. People take part in a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on Sunday. ADALBERTO ROQUE / AFP - Getty Images ""I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,"" local resident Claris Ramirez said by phone. ""They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine,"" she added. Diaz-Canel, who had just returned from San Antonio de los Banos, said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and ""mercenaries"" on the ground, and he warned that further ""provocations"" would not be tolerated. There were protests later on Sunday hundreds of miles to the east in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba, where social media video showed hundreds marching through the streets, again confirmed by a local resident. ""They are protesting the crisis, that there is no food or medicine, that you have to buy everything at the foreign currency stores, and on and on the list goes,"" Claudia Perez said. ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations,"" Diaz-Canel said in his broadcast remarks. The Communist-run country has been experiencing a worsening economic crisis for two years, which the government blames mainly on U.S. sanctions and the pandemic, while its detractors cite incompetence and a Soviet-style one-party system.",[],7/11/2021 22:54,Thousands of protesters take to the streets in Cuba,"['streets', 'havana', 'media', 'video', 'protesting', 'seen', 'thousands', 'protests', 'cuba', 'social', 'hundreds', 'diazcanel', 'protesters']","HAVANA -- Thousands of Cubans took to the streets from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in rarely seen protests, expressing frustration over pandemic restrictions, the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations and what they said was government neglect.

31,https://www.trtworld.com/americas/rare-anti-government-protests-in-cuba-as-pandemic-stirs-emotions-48284,"Fast News Thousands of people have joined rallies across the country as they express anger over food and energy shortages. Anti-government protests erupt in Cuba as the government struggles to deal with the pandemic. (AP) Thousands of Cubans across the country took part in rare protests against the communist government, marching through several towns as they called for democracy and liberty. The demonstrations started in the morning on Sunday, as the country endures its worst economic crisis in 30 years. The only authorised gatherings are normally Communist Party events. Several thousand protesters took to the streets of San Antonio de los Banos, a town of some 50,000 people, 30 kilometres (20 miles) southwest of Havana. Some of the demonstrators, mainly young people, shouted insults against President Miguel Diaz-Canel.

Diaz-Canel blamed US sanctions imposed by Donald Trump and left unchanged by President Joe Biden for misery people are facing. He accused ""a Cuban-American mafia"" of whipping up the protests on social media. ""People have come to express their dissatisfaction with the situation they are living in,"" he said. One local, on condition of anonymity, told AFP that she participated in the demonstration as she was exasperated by ""the situation with electricity and food."" Public anger Protests also erupted in Havana, with a few hundred people present, while social media showed other demonstrations in the country. Public anger has been driven by long food lines, worsening power shortages for several hours a day and a critical shortage of medicines since the start of the Covid-19 epidemic, with Cuba under US sanctions. Cuba is experiencing its toughest phase yet of the coronavirus epidemic, and on Sunday reported a new daily record of infections and deaths. The country of 11.2 million people was left relatively unscathed in the first months of the Covid outbreak but has seen a recent hike in infections, with a new record of 6,923 daily cases reported Sunday and 47 deaths for a total of 1,537.

The anti-government protest in the capital of Havana lasted about 2  1/2  hours before it was broken up when a few protesters tossed cobblestones at police, leading to several arrests. Before its conclusion, hordes of demonstrators, many of them young, marched around the capital chanting ""Freedom,"" ""Enough"" and ""Unite"" with police trailing behind them. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-aged protester told The Associated Press. The communist country is suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades and has recently seen a surge in coronavirus cases. The protesters demonstrated against recent food shortages and high prices in Cuba during the countrys current economic crisis.

""Why is it so hard for @potus & the people in his administration to say that?""

35,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-socialists-ignore-cuban-protesters-railing-against-communist-dictatorship,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Anti-government protests broke out Sunday in Cuba demanding freedom and calling on the disbandment of the countrys communist dictatorship, all while some of the U.S. most outspoken, self-professed Democratic socialists appear to be in lockstep by not acknowledging the historic events unfolding on the island about 90 miles from Florida. Fox News has emailed Reps. Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Sen. Bernie Sanders and has yet to receive a response from any of them. As of early Monday, none have even mentioned the protest on social media. But Tuesday afternoon, asked by Fox News for comment on Cuba, Sanders said: ""Well, I support throughout Latin America and Cuba and every place else the right of people to protest for a decent economy and for political freedom."" -BERNIE SANDERS: well, I support throughout latin America and cuba and every place else the right of people to protest for a decent economy and for political freedom Thousands of Cubans marched on Havanas Malecon promenade and elsewhere to protest food shortages, high prices and the coronavirus outbreak in one of the biggest anti-government demonstrations in the country ever. MEDIA OUTLETS VILIFY DONALD RUMSFELD IN OBITUARIES AFTER GOING GENTLE ON FIDEL CASTRO Police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted ""Freedom,"" ""Enough"" and ""Unite."" One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. The Biden administration was criticized on social media for appearing to have difficulty finding its footing on how to respond to the protests. VIDEO EMERGES OF MASS PROTESTS AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP IN CUBA: 'WE ARE NOT AFRAID Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, took the State Department to task over a tweet that blamed the protest on concerns over COVID-19 and not the worsening economic situation or the fact that protesters chanted, ""We Want Liberty."" ""People in Cuba are protesting 62 years of socialism, lies, tyranny & misery not 'expressing concern about rising COVID-19 cases/deaths. Why is it so hard for @Potus & the people in his administration to say that?"" Rubio tweeted. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Critics will likely say that these Democratic socialists are remaining quiet in the early stages of the protests because there are so many unknowns. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who heads the Communist Party, has already called on the countrys revolutionaries to counter the demonstrators. ""We are prepared to do anything,"" he said during a national address. ""We will be battling in the streets."" LIVE UPDATES: CLICK HERE FOR LATEST NEWS ON CUBA He continued, ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations."" Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, took to Twitter to say the ""U.S. supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights."" There has been an uneasy relationship between Cuban-Americans and the extreme left of the Democrat Party. Ocasio-Cortez once took to Twitter to defend ""progressivism"" against claims that some of the policies sent minority voters into the Republican column in 2020. The Democratic socialist tweeted, ""But honestly when it comes to Latinos the partys just never seriously made an effort,"" apparently referring to the Democrat Party. ""Mexicans, Central Am, Caribbean, Chicanos -- Cubans are not the only impt community."" The Trump administration won the favor with a bloc of Cuban American voters who support his hardline stance on Cuba after he abandoned attempts at diplomacy brokered under former President Barack Obama, reimposed economic sanctions and tightened travel restrictions that had been relaxed under Obama. The National Review reported that these legislators have never even denounced Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Maduro as a ""brutal dictator"" and vowed to continue recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuelas rightful leader -- a position shared by more than 50 nations. In 2019, Omar, D-Minn., went as far as to accuse the U.S. government of leading a coup against Maduro. Sanders, I-Vt., once defended some of the policies of Cuba's previous communist dictator Fidel Castro. Following his win during Nevada's caucus in the 2020 Democratic primaries, Sanders was asked by Anderson Cooper during an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" why the Cuban people didn't rise up and help the U.S. overthrow the Castro regime. Sanders replied that the dictator ""educated their kids, gave their kids health care, totally transformed the society."" ""We're very very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad,"" Sanders explained. ""You know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?"" Republicans have taken to social media to support the protesters in their effort. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Ted Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, took to Twitter on Sunday in support of the thousands of protesters. Cruz reposted a video that claimed to show dozens in front of the Communist Party Headquarters and said the current regime will be ""consigned to the dustbin of history.""

On Sunday, protests broke out in Havana and several other Cuban cities, during which people chanted ""Freedom!"" and ""Down with the dictatorship!"" while marching against Communist Party institutions. The New York Times noted that while the demonstrations were triggered by ""food and medicine shortages,"" they also ""openly protested against the Communist government"" for the first time in nearly 30 years. Some activists called it the largest spontaneous popular protest since Fidel Castro took power in 1959, with protesters openly denouncing the regime of Miguel Diaz-Canel.

Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need. -- Julie Chung (@WHAAsstSecty) July 11, 2021 The administrations statement ignored democracy and freedom altogether. Cubans do not have the ""right to peaceful assembly""; like many rights in the Cuban Constitution, it exists only in theory. The Biden administrations attempt to spin the protests as a demonstration about COVID-19 mirrors the rhetoric of the 2020 presidential election, during which Democrats charged that the Trump administration had failed on the pandemic. It could also be an effort to defend the Obama administrations ""normalization"" policy toward Cuba, in which then-Vice President Biden participated, which restored full diplomatic relations with the regime but failed to demand democratic reforms or progress on human rights.

""The moment that we have to focus on is how to attend to what is problematic, how to achieve financial capacity,"" Diaz-Canal said in a video clip posted to Twitter.

39,https://nypost.com/2021/07/12/cuba-blames-us-for-uprising-against-communist-regime/,"Cubas Communist regime is trying to blame the US for the huge uprising against its totalitarian government -- as it also calls on ""revolutionaries"" to take to the streets and ""fight"" any anti-government protesters. On Sunday, thousands took to the streets in cities and towns across the long-suffering nation, screaming ""Freedom"" and ""Enough"" -- as well as anti-government slogans and demands for the removal of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The dictatorship responded with a huge police presence, dispatching special forces jeeps with machine guns mounted on the back. Dozens of demonstrators were arrested in the countrys capital, Havana. There were also clashes with government supporters, who were blamed for assaulting journalists as Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon to stop news getting out.

AFP via Getty Images Despite the protesters clear calls of ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""Down with Diaz-Canel,"" the Cuban leader blamed the uprising on ""the Cuban-American mafia"" and ""influencers and YouTubers."" ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations,"" he said in an ominous warning.

""It can end today and it must end today,"" he said, according to NBC-6. Protesters take to the streets in Miami to protest the Cuban Communist regime on July 11, 2021.

An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sundays demonstrations. ""Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages,"" tweeted Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for Western Hemisphere affairs.

US national security adviser Jake Sullivan also said that ""the US supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights."" The message was echoed by numerous US lawmakers. A demonstrators protests in front of workers of the Institute of Radio and Television in Havana, Cuba. EPA/Ernesto Mastrascusa ""Its time for the Cuban regime to step down and let Democracy flourish in Cuba,"" tweeted Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he will ask President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to urge members of the Cuban military to stand with the people of Cuba. ""The incompetent communist party of #Cuba cannot feed or protect the people from the virus,"" he tweeted. ""Now those in the military must defend the people not the communist party,"" he tweeted. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), who represents the Miami area, said the ""humanitarian crisis Cuba faces right now is yet another symptom of the incompetence and absolute cruelty of the Cuban tyranny."" ""The world has the obligation to stand with the brave Cuban people,"" Salazar said in a statement. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, also urged the US to ""stand in solidarity with the brave people of Cuba that are risking their lives today for change in their country and a future of Patria y Vida."" People partaking in the protests -- which are very uncommon in Cuba -- on July 11, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Cubas director-general for US affairs, Carlos F. de Cossio, lashed out at the US support of the uprising. ""US State Department and its officials, involved to their necks in promoting social and political instability in #Cuba, should avoid expressing hypocritical concern for a situation they have been betting on,"" de Cossio tweeted. ""Cuba is and will continue to be a peaceful country, contrary to the US."" The demonstrations -- the biggest anti-government protests on the Communist-run island in decades -- were largely stoked by Cubas worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, its old ally, 30 years ago.

40,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-thousands-nationwide-take-streets-against-communism/,"Thousands of Cubans in at least 16 cities took the streets peacefully on Sunday to demand an end to the 62-year-old communist regime, chanting ""freedom,"" wearing American flags, and in many cases facing extreme police repression. Videos from throughout the island show both plain-clothed and uniformed state security officers attacking peaceful protesters. In Havana, bystanders recorded the sound of heavy gunfire and public beatings of dissidents. Miguel Diaz-Canel, the ""president"" appointed by Raul Castro to be the face of the still-ruling Castro Communist Party, called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime in a speech on Sunday. The protests appeared to begin in the town of San Antonio de los Banos, western Cuba, on Sunday morning. Local independent outlets documented chants of ""down with communism!"", ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"", among other anti-government statements. Locals livestreamed the protest on Facebook, triggering an outpouring into the streets of at least 16 major cities including both Havana and Santiago de Cuba, on opposite ends of the island. The geographically widespread nature of the protests and the secrecy of the Communist Party on the island has made it virtually impossible to estimate exactly how many Cubans took the streets on Sunday. Police have not released any arrest totals or injury statistics, but some local outlets estimate that hundreds were arrested, taken into police stations but not formally charged or appearing in any law enforcement documentation. Among the arrested were several Cuban journalists not participating but reporting on the protests, according to the dissident news service Cubanet. Also arrested on Sunday, though rapidly released, was Yomil Hidalgo, one of Cubas most popular dance music artists. The American flag, popularized as a protest symbol in Cuba by dissident Daniel Llorente, made multiple appearances among Cubans on Sunday. Video authenticated by the Miami broadcaster AmericaTeve showed a group of Cubans carrying an American flag through the streets of Havana on Sunday while chanting ""freedom!"" Videos taken by Cubans on social media and distributed through other Latin American news organizations also show the presence of the U.S. flag. In Mayabeque, a Havana suburb, a crowd of hundreds congregated in front of an image of the Virgin Mary to pray for an end to the communist regime. At least one participant can be seen wearing an American flag shirt while praying. Pre-Castro Cuba was a majority Catholic nation. Under communism, the regime has outlawed most religious practices it cannot control and regularly persecutes Christians who defy its authority. Fidel Castro sent non-Catholic Christians - primarily Jehovahs Witnesses and Seventh-Day Adventists - to labor camps alongside suspected LGBT people, writers and critics, and other ""undesirables"" in the 1960s. Reports of the beating and arrest of at least one Catholic priest, Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, surfaced on Sunday. Alvarez reportedly disappeared in Camaguey, one of the most active protest centers, and resurfaced under the custody of the Communist Partys secret police. Camaguey, in the central rural heartland of the island, experienced some of the most violent communist repression on Sunday. Local journalists and citizens recorded police publicly beating protesters. Citizens fought back with rocks - legal weapon ownership in communist Cuba does not exist - in at least one occasion successfully pushing back a police car to protect dissidents in one neighborhood. Citizens appear to begin throwing rocks after police open fire on unarmed, peaceful civilians, hitting at least one man. An extremely dramatic video of Cuban citizens overturning a police car and standing on it in triumph also surfaced on Sunday. Sources differ on where it was taken, but it appears to be in either Havana or Cardenas, a city about 100 miles east of the capital. Other reports indicated heavy gunfire from police at peaceful protesters in Havana. As Havana is one of Cubas most densely populated urban centers, opening fire on a tightly packed crowd would likely result in significant injuries, but Cuban authorities have not issued any reports on the damage police caused at press time. The gunfire was an apparent attempt to keep protesters out of the Plaza of the Revolution, the Spain-based Diario de Cuba reported. The Plaza is the crown jewel of communist architecture in Havana, featuring Soviet-style metal portraits of Fidel Castro, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, and other mass murderers. Diario de Cuba, citing a reporter on the ground, stated that police surrounded the Plaza and deployed a communist mob to wave photos of Fidel Castro. Police carrying baseball bats offered protection to the state-sponsored mob. Photos of the pro-Castro mob in Havana appeared in Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, late Sunday appear to confirm those reports. Diaz-Canel appeared on television Sunday to call all communists to violently attack any protesters, effectively urging civil war. ""We are willing to give our lives. They will have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution,"" Diaz-Canel warned. ""We are willing to do anything."" ""We are convening all revolutionary communists to go out to the streets where these provocations are happening and confront them with firmness,"" he commanded. ""The order of combat is issued, revolutionaries to the streets.""

The streets of Havana were quiet on Monday, although there was a heavy police presence and the capitol building, where more than a thousand had congregated the day before, was cordoned off. Outages in mobile internet - the only way many Cubans have of accessing the web - were frequent. Thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades. They were protesting against the country's dire economic crisis and handling of the pandemic, but many went further, calling for an end to communism and chanting ""freedom."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register At least 100 protesters, activists, and independent journalists had been detained nationwide since Sunday, according to exiled rights group Cubalex - some at the protests but others as they tried to leave their homes. ""It's becoming impossible to live here,"" said Havana resident Maykel, 21, who declined to give his surname for fear of retaliation. ""I don't know if this can happen again, because at the moment, Havana is militarized."" ""Still, Cubans are losing their fear,"" he said. Others Reuters spoke to said they hoped there would be no more protests, citing fears of violence, and saying they would prefer there to be more dialogue. The protests erupted amid both Cuba's deepest economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union and a surge in COVID-19 infections that has pushed some hospitals to the edge of collapse in a country that prides itself on its healthcare system. The tightening of decades-old U.S. sanctions under former U.S. President Donald Trump and the pandemic have exacerbated shortages of food and medicine, as well as power outages. A minority of counter-revolutionaries were fomenting unrest, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a more than four-hour-long televised address alongside his Cabinet. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez blamed U.S.-financed mercenaries. In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden said the United States stood with the people of Cuba who were ""bravely"" asserting their right to peaceful protest, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Cuban officials should not blame the protests on U.S. sanctions. ""It would be a grievous mistake because it would show that they simply are not hearing the voices and will of the Cuban people,"" he told a news briefing. Some Cuban celebrities who have to date not touched on sensitive political issues publicly came out in support of the protesters. ""Their voices should be heard and their rights to express themselves respected,"" said singer-songwriter Cimafunk, whose real name is Erik Rodriguez. ""We need to unite and find the path forward together, peacefully."" In Miami, home to a large community of Cuban Americans, hundreds turned out in Little Havana on Sunday to express solidarity and celebrate what they viewed as the beginning of the end. On Twitter, Miami mayor Francis Suarez implored the United States to ""take action."" VIOLENCE Diaz-Canel denounced vandalism that took place during the demonstrations. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel talks to the media, in San Antonio de los Banos, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini ""They threw stones at foreign currency shops, they stole items... and at police forces, they turned over cars - a totally vulgar, indecent and delinquent behavior,"" he said. But the president said pro-government supporters had finally restored order, after on Sunday instructing them to fight back and ""defend the revolution"" - orders that caused consternation among some Cubans. Reuters witnesses saw protesters in Havana on Sunday confronted by smaller pro-government counter-rallies, while police officers stopped their attempt to march to Revolution Square. Amnesty International said it had received with alarm reports of ""internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force - including police firing on demonstrators."" Reuters was unable to independently verify the use of firearms. Network monitoring company Kentik said it had observed the entire country go offline for less than 30 minutes at around 4pm on Sunday, followed by several hours of intermittent outages. ""Until very recently, large internet outages were very rare,"" said Doug Madory, Kentik's director of Internet analysis. ""Internet shutdowns are new to Cuba in 2021."" Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks said there was partial disruption to social media and messaging platforms in Cuba on Monday, ""likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba."" The United Nations said it was monitoring the protests and called for the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be respected. Jose Daniel, the leader of Cuba's largest opposition group, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), was arrested as he left home to join the protest in Santiago de Cuba in the east of the country on Sunday. His whereabouts is unknown, UNPACU activist Zaqueo Baez told Reuters. Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and Amaury Pacheco, two members of a dissident artists' collective that has made headlines spearheading a broader protest movement in Cuba in recent years, were arrested on their way to protest in Havana, Pacheco's partner Iris Ruiz told Reuters. Otero Alcantara was in jail while Pacheco's whereabouts were unknown. Another well-known dissident, Coco Farinas, was arrested as he left home on Monday in the central town of Santa Clara, his mother Alicia Fernandez told Reuters. The Cuban government did not immediately comment on the arrests. Cuba slams dissidents as mercenaries in the pay of the United States and allied with anti-Castro Cuban exiles. ""It feels like a dangerous moment,"" Ruiz said by phone, noting her neighborhood had had no mobile data all day. ""I'm worried about the kind of reprisals they could take against activists - they have been increasingly plying the theory that we are terrorists lately."" Julie Chung, Acting Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, called for the immediate release of them and others. Diaz-Canel attacked what he called Washington's hypocrisy for expressing concern when it was fueling the crisis in Cuba with its trade embargo. The United States tightened sanctions on Cuba under Trump, including restricting crucial remittances in the middle of the pandemic. Biden vowed during his campaign to ease some of these measures but has yet to do so, with the White House saying it was not among his top priorities. ""Is it not very hypocritical and cynical that you block me... and you want to present yourself as the big savior?"" he said. He said the government had been fighting to keep the economy functioning ""in the face of a policy of economic asphyxiation intended to provoke a social uprising.""

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden said on Monday the United States supports the people of Cuba in their call for freedom and relief from the pandemic and economic woes, but the White House stopped short of a shift away from a Trump-era embargo of the island. Thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations in Communist-run Cuba in decades. They chanted ""freedom"" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down. Biden referred to the protests as ""remarkable"" and told reporters at the White House that the Cuban people were ""demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register He called on Cuban leaders to allow the protests to proceed without violence. ""The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights, and we call on the government... to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba,"" Biden said. He declined to answer questions about whether the United States would alter its policy toward Cuba, and White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki gave no indication of an immediate shift. Biden's administration has been reviewing its approach to Cuba since he took over from Republican President Donald Trump, who had closed the door to increased tourism to the Caribbean island nation opened up by Democratic President Barack Obama. ""We are assessing how we can be helpful to the people of Cuba,"" Psaki said. The protests erupted amid both Cuba's worst economic crisis since the 1990s and a record surge in coronavirus infections. People denounced shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected,"" Biden said in a statement earlier on Monday. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" Diaz-Canel on Monday blamed U.S. sanctions, which were tightened in recent years, for problems such as medicine shortages and power outages. Psaki said U.S. policy still allowed significant amounts of aid to get through to Havana.

45,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-cuba-socialism-failure-protests-historic-economic-crisis,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Republicans are pointing to unrest in Cuba as evidence that socialist policies ultimately fail, despite a trend among far-left Democrats to embrace them. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana over the weekend to lash out at the worsening conditions in the country under the communist regime, as Cuba faces its worst economic crisis in decades. CUBAN ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTERS WAVE AMERICAN FLAGS DURING MARCH ""Socialism leads to pain and suffering and Cuba is the perfect example,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a statement. ""Biden must pressure Cuba to provide assurances that they will not fire on their own people. This is a major test for Biden. He must exert leadership and American influence."" Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had particularly strong words against Cuba's system of government. ""Protests in #Cuba arent simply about 'shortages Socialism promises guaranteed food, medicine & income if you give up your freedom,"" Rubio tweeted. ""When, as always, it fails to deliver you dont get your freedom back."" Cruz spoke out against the ""tyranny"" of the Cuban government, noting that his family fled from the country. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS IGNORE CUBAN PROTESTERS RAILING AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP ""The Cuban people have fought against the tyranny of the Communist regime for decades, and have taken to the streets demanding liberty,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""This regime has brutalized and denied freedom to generations of Cubans, forcing many including my family to flee or be murdered, and over the coming days will widen its violence to try to suppress the brave protesters in the streets."" Meanwhile, self-professed Democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appear to be in lockstep by not acknowledging what is happening in Cuba.

47,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuban-president-defiant-blames-embargo-after-massive-protests-n1273716,"A day after thousands of demonstrators took to Cuba's streets in rare protest of the island nation's economic crisis, large contingents of police were dispatched to patrol in the capital of Havana and the island nation's president blamed a U.S. embargo for the widespread shortages of food, fuel, medicine and other goods during the pandemic. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Monday that a ""politics of economic asphyxiation"" was having a ""cumulative effect"" throughout Cuba. He and representatives from his government said U.S. sanctions against Cuba had contributed to power outages and limited access to food and medical supplies during the pandemic. Speaking of the economic issues in Cuban society and the reasons some have been protesting, Diaz-Canel said, ""What is their origin, what is their cause? It is the blockade."" Diaz-Canel said the Cuban protests were the result of a U.S. and social media campaign to manipulate people while the island is facing hardship during the pandemic. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets across the country on Sunday, shouting slogans against the government such as, ""We want freedom"" and ""We are no longer afraid."" Rights groups and opposition activists reported dozens were unaccounted for or detained on Monday following the protests. But outages in internet connectivity made it difficult to determine the scope of arrests. Cuban police patrolled in the capital of Havana in large numbers on Monday, according to The Associated Press. A man is arrested during a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on Sunday. Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images Diaz-Canel said it was legitimate ""to have dissatisfactions, but also we have to be capable to visualize, to define when we're being manipulated, where they want to separate us."" He said forces that want to appear as ""saviors"" to Cuba ""are not interested in the health of the people."" ""They want to change a system, or a regime they call it, to impose what type of government and what type of regime in Cuba? The privatization of public services. The kind that gives more possibility to the rich minority and not the majority."" Cuba's health minister said that the embargo has impacted Cuba's ability to combat the virus through restrictions on medications and supplies to make medicines, as well as equipment such as ventilators. Diaz-Canel also denounced what he called the ""Cuban mafia"" in Miami, referring to Cuban American community members and legislators opposed to the Communist government. Cuba is currently facing its worst economic crisis in decades, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, worsened by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic drove tourism, which was a critical driver of the island economy, to a halt. The country has since seen food shortages, power outages and mounting coronavirus cases. It has also seen an increase in repression against political opponents and a strained health system during a critical stage of the pandemic. Health authorities reported almost 7,000 new cases and 47 deaths -- a record for infections and deaths on the Caribbean island of just over 11 million people. Plainclothes police detain a protester in Havana on Sunday. Ramon Espinosa / AP In Havana, protests disrupted traffic on Sunday until police moved in after several hours and broke up the march when a few protesters threw rocks, according to the AP. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-aged protester told the AP. He declined to identify himself for fear of being arrested later. Later, about 300 pro-government protesters arrived with a large Cuban flag, shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution, the AP reported. Some assaulted an AP videojournalist, smashing his camera. AP photojournalist Ramon Espinosa was then beaten by a group of police officers in uniforms and civilian clothes; he suffered a broken nose and an eye injury. The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages, the AP reported. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon. More than two hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. In Miami, hundreds of people gathered in the Little Havana neighborhood in solidarity with the growing protests in Cuba. ""I know my family in Cuba is struggling, people are dying. Its terrible,"" Miami resident Christian Guzman told NBC station WTVJ. ""Right now, its hard. Theres no food, theres no medicine. The Covid outbreak. The whole country is in the streets,"" Miami resident Dario Suarez said. Diaz-Canel appeared on national television earlier to call on the army to confront the protesters: ""The order to fight has been given,"" he said. Diaz-Canel also called ""all the revolutionaries in the country, all the communists, to take to the streets and go to the places where these provocations are going to take place."" U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday said he recognized the ""remarkable protests in Cuba"" and that such demonstrations had not been seen in a long time, ""frankly ever."" Biden said the U.S. stands ""firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights"" and called on the government to ""refrain from violence"" or ""attempts to silence"" the protesters. Earlier Monday, Biden said in a statement the Cuban protests were a ""clarion call for freedom."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves,"" he added. Also on Monday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called for the U.S. embargo of Cuba to end. ""The truth is that if one wanted to help Cuba, the first thing that should be done is to suspend the blockade of Cuba as the majority of countries in the world are asking,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference, according to Reuters.","['Daniella Silva Is A Reporter For Nbc News', 'Focusing On Education', 'How Laws', 'Policies', 'Practices Affect Students', 'Teachers.

48,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-communists-issue-order-of-combat-against-peaceful-protesters/,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the face of the Castro communist regime, announced an ""order of combat"" on Sunday against peaceful pro-democracy protesters, urging communist civilians to assault them. Thousands of Cubans nationwide, in at least 20 municipalities including Havana and Santiago de Cuba, flooded the streets of the country on Sunday in peaceful protests demanding an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. With chants of ""freedom!"" and some wearing or waving American flags, the protesters attracted outsized police violence. Videos taken by civilians and posted to social media show protesters facing live gunshots, receiving gang beatings at the hands of state security officers, and fleeing from tear gas and rubber bullets. In remarks on national television, Diaz-Canel encouraged violence against the protesters not just on the part of the police, but on the part of Cuban civilians who sympathize with the regime. ""We will not hand over our sovereignty, or the independence of the people, or the freedom of this nation. We are many revolutionaries in this people who are willing to give our lives ... for conviction,"" Diaz-Canel said, according to the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, Granma. ""They have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution and we are willing to do everything and will be on the streets combatting."" ""This is why we are calling all the revolutionaries of our country, all the communists, to go to the streets anywhere that these provocations are happening today, from now on through all these days,"" Diaz-Canel urged. The Castro underling declared an ""order of combat"" against the peaceful protesters and accused them of being ""annexationists."" ""We will not allow any mercenary counterrevolutionary bought off the by the government of the United States, a sellout to the Empire ... to destabilize our country,"" he asserted. No evidence has surfaced since the protests began of any American government influence in the protests, nor have any reports surfaced of American citizens being involved at press time. Some protesters did take the streets waving the American flag or wearing American flag clothing, as the flag has become a global symbol of human rights and freedom - most prominent in this context during the 2019 Hong Kong anti-communist protests. The Castro regime attempted to organize pro-communist rallies on Sunday in response to the massive outpouring of rejection for the regime, shutting down Havanas Plaza of the Revolution and bringing in government cronies. The pro-Castro mobs were dwarfed by the thousands in nearly every major city in the country calling for an end to the regime. Cuban government officials have not released any official estimates on how many people participated in the protests or how many were arrested. As the protests erupted spontaneously, no dissident group has any realistic sense of just how many people took the streets. Most major journalistic outlets are estimating the number of protesters to be in the thousands, however, fueled largely by the rallies in Havana, Santiago, and Camaguey. The anti-Castro outlet ADN Cuba reported that as many as 20 localities nationwide documented protests; it also reported at least one beaten to death in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba. Protesters were largely peaceful but endured a violent crackdown. Isolated incidents occurred in which protesters flipped over a police car - in response to police attempting to assault protesters - and at least one incident of looting of a government-run store. Much more commonly, protesters chanted ""freedom!"" and ""down with communism!"" in many protests, while others targeted Diaz-Canel personally, though he serves largely as a figurehead for the larger Castro family apparatus. Videos surfacing on social media before the regime cut access to the internet appear to reflect the sound of gunshots from police in Havana and locals reported multiple civilians injured. Camaguey, Guantanamo, and Matanzas also reported police street beatings, gunshots, and use of tear gas to deter protesters. No reports have surfaced of any protester carrying a weapon, though some attempted to throw rocks at police officers beating fellow protesters in the street. In addition to the protesters, multiple reports have surfaced of violent beatings and arrests of journalists. Among the most dramatic images to come out of the protests is that of Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa, who police assaulted for unknown reasons while doing his job in Havana. Police raids appeared to continue in the early morning hours of Monday. ADN Cuba reported that at least one Havana neighborhood woke up to police gunshots against people believed to be protesters. An anonymous source in Havana told the outlet that police special forces were hunting suspected protesters ""like dogs"" and that any attempt to resist arrests, beatings, or worse was largely futile without weapons. In Cardenas, Matanzas province, reports surfaced on Monday of families attempting to visit relatives in the hospital after police shot them and having police keep them out of the hospitals. Police have prevented protesters and journalists from compiling an accurate list of those injured or killed on Sunday.

49,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cubans-protesting-communism-with-american-flag-because-its-a-symbol-of-freedom-rep-gimenez,"Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., called on the U.S. to support protests in Cuba to end communist rule, Monday, arguing on ""America Reports"" that America is the symbol of freedom that has been denied to the Cuban people for 60 years. REPUBLICANS SPOTLIGHT CUBA AS SOCIALISM FAILURE AS PROTESTS ERUPT AMID HISTORIC ECONOMIC CRISIS REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ: The people of Cuba want their freedom. They want freedom to speak freely. They want freedom of the press. They want free and democratic elections. They want basic human rights, which have been denied to them for 60 years. And so what you're seeing now is the young people that have actually grown up in the system have figured out, hey, this system doesn't work for us, it doesn't work for anybody, has never worked for anybody, and we want freedom. And so, again, if they've lost the fear of the government and the security forces, then it could be a really good sign that this is the beginning of the end. We in the United States have to support this effort by the young people and the Cuban people for their freedom. We need to also continue the sanctions that that President Trump started a couple of years ago, deny them access to credit, because that's what's happening. The Cuban government cannot pay their bills and they haven't been able to pay their bills for years. So credit is being denied to them. That's why these shortages they have and food and medicines and all that, all because of the failed economic policies of communism. And let's call it what it is. It's communism. And that's the root cause. ... Look at the images coming out of Cuba, right. They've got people there waving the American flag because that is the symbol of freedom. And that's why my family brought me here to this country and that's why I'm in Congress, to fight to make sure that America stays free.

50,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jul/12/thousands-march-in-cuba-in-rare-mass-protests-amid-economic-crisis,"The biggest mass demonstrations for three decades have rippled through Cuba, as thousands took to the streets in cities throughout the island, demonstrating against food shortages, high prices and communist rule. The protests began in the morning, in the town of San Antonio de los Banos in the west of the island, and in the city of Palma Soriano in the east. In both cases protesters numbered in the hundreds. With millions of Cubans now with mobile internet on their phones, news of the protests quickly swept to Havana. By early afternoon, thousands marched through central Havana, chanting ""homeland and life"" and ""freedom"". ""Im here because of hunger, because theres no medicine, because of power cuts - because theres a lack of everything,"" said a man in his 40s who didnt want to give his name for fear of reprisals. ""I want a total change: a change of government, multiparty elections, and the end of communism."" The protesters were met by uniformed and plainclothes police officers, who bundled hundreds of demonstrators - many of them violent - into police cars. Youths tore up paving slabs and hurled them at police; police used pepper spray and beat protesters with truncheons. One policeman, hit on the head with a cobblestone, was sped away in a car that nearly ran over a protester. With a rock in each hand, Yusniel Perez, 17, said: ""Were here because were hungry and poor. We dont have food. We dont have anything."" At 3pm local time all television channels were interrupted with a broadcast from President Miguel Diaz-Canel who said that ""destabilisation in our country"" would be met with a ""revolutionary response"". ""We call upon all the revolutionaries of the country, all the communists, to take to the streets."" A game of cat and mouse ensued, where young anti-government protesters tried to occupy iconic parts of the capital, only to be blocked off by older government supporters, state security and the army. Aylin Guerrero, 52, was one of thousands who came out to support the government, in central Havana. ""We are the people and we have come out to support our conquests"", she said, surrounded by thousands of government supporters some bearing wooden clubs. ""Even if were not communists, were patriots."" Government supporters accused anti-government protesters of being mercenaries paid by the United States, which spend approximately 20 million dollars a year on ""democracy promotion"" on the island. As evening fell, state forces and supporters had reclaimed the streets. Government supporters gathering at the Maximo Gomez monument in Havana on Sunday.

Cubans are living through the gravest economic crisis the country has known for 30 years. The Trump administration hammered the island with more than 200 new sanctions aimed at sabotaging the islands economy and stirring discontent, measures that have so far been left untouched by the Biden administration. Since the pandemic, which has gutted tourism revenue, Cubans have become accustomed to waiting in line for hours to buy basic goods like chicken and detergent. Pharmacy shelves are barren.

Photograph: Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images The protests were the biggest since 1994, when tens of thousands demonstrated at Havanas Malecon promenade amid an acute economic crisis brought on by the fall of the Soviet Union. An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sundays demonstrations. Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for western hemisphere affairs, tweeted: ""Peaceful protests are growing in Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising Covid cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need.""",['Ed Augustin'],7/12/2021 15:40,Thousands march in Cuba in rare mass protests amid economic crisis,"['havana', 'mass', 'state', 'support', 'amid', 'thousands', 'protests', 'rare', 'cuba', 'island', 'cuban', 'economic', 'country', 'crisis', 'supporters', 'protesters']","The biggest mass demonstrations for three decades have rippled through Cuba, as thousands took to the streets in cities throughout the island, demonstrating against food shortages, high prices and communist rule.

While on the campaign trail, President Biden said he would restore Obama-era diplomatic ties with Cuba -- despite the nations close ties with Venezuela's strongman Nicolas Maduro. During an appearance on CBS Miami in April 2020, then-candidate Biden was asked if he would restore Obamas policy of engagement with the communist country. ""Yes, I would. In large part, I would go back,"" Biden said. ""Id still insist they keep the commitments they said they would make when we, in fact, set the policy in place."" In 2014, President Obama moved to normalize relations with Cuba, effectively undoing more than 50 years of U.S. policy - including a trade embargo - with the island nation. Then in 2017, President Trump reversed his predecessors policy on Cuba, calling it a ""terrible and misguided deal."" In the April 2020 interview, Biden downplayed the idea that he would be rewarding Cuba despite them propping up Maduro in Venezuela. CUBAN PRESIDENT URGES COUNTRY'S 'REVOLUTIONARY CITIZENS TO COUNTER PROTESTERS ""Well, theyre having great difficulty propping up Maduro,"" Biden said. ""Number one, Maduro is in real trouble. Number two, theres no reason why we cannot still sanction them, but failing to recognize them at all is a different thing than sanctioning them."" While campaigning for reelection, Trumps team said Biden would be following ""Bernie Sanders lead and side with socialist dictatorships over our countrys values."" ""It's bad enough that as vice president, Biden never lifted a finger to stop Maduro as he starved his own people and that his administration praised Raul Castro, giving the Cuban government a pass despite its horrific human rights record,"" Trump campaigns deputy communications director, Ali Pardo said. ""Now, just like Biden sold out Americans while his son Hunter made millions doing business with communist China, he's selling out the Cuban and Venezuelan people to win over the  chavista wing of the Democrat Party."" SANDERS LOVES TRASHING REPUBLICANS BUT WON'T CONDEMN TRULY OPPRESSIVE CUBAN COMMUNISTS Though Biden pledged to restore the Obama-era policy, he has yet to do so as president. Still, his comments on Cuba are getting renewed attention amid rare street protests that broke out in Havana on Sunday. The demonstrations in Havana and other communities around Cuba marked some of the biggest displays of anti-government sentiment in decades, and authorities appeared determined to put a stop to them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News has reached out to the White House to inquire about the administration's position on Cuba following the unrest, but did not hear back before publication.

52,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/new-york-times-cuba-protests-freedom-is-anti-government-slogan/,"The New York Times described chants of ""freedom!"" at thousands-strong peaceful protests in Cuba on Sunday as one of several ""anti-government slogans"" popular among the congregated. The Times also erroneously reported the protests were about ""food and medicine shortages."" ""Shouting 'Freedom and other anti-government slogans, hundreds of Cubans took to the streets in cities around the country on Sunday to protest food and medicine shortages, in a remarkable eruption of discontent not seen in nearly 30 years,"" the Times wrote. In reality, the thousands of protesters used slogans against socialism and communism to made clear the political nature of their demand: the end of communism on the island. The Times coverage also included weaponizing Cuban disinformation by suggesting communist Cubas ""longstanding economic problems"" stem from ""the American trade embargo, which cuts off its access to financing and imports."" ""In televised remark,"" the Times persisted, ""Diaz-Canel said ... the protests were a form of 'systemic provocation by dissidents doing the bidding of the United States."" ""Within hours of the extraordinary events, the president broke into national television programming to urge government supporters to hit the streets and confront the protesters,"" the Times reported, tempering in its translation that Diaz-Canel issued an ""order of combat"" encouraging civilians to violently assault protesters on the streets. The Times narrow coverage contradicts videos from throughout the island that show both plain-clothed and uniformed state security officers attacking peaceful protesters. Breitbart News reported bystanders in Havana heard sounds of heavy gunfire and beatings of dissidents, while Diaz-Canel called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime. The Times has been historically sympathetic to the Castro regime. In the 1950s, while most Cubans supported efforts against then-President Fulgencio Batista organized by more popular leaders, New York Times reporter Herbert Matthews published flattering, and false, reports praising Fidel Castro and his band of Marxists. Matthews reports, beginning in 1957, portrayed Castro as a freedom fighter seeking to restore democracy to the island nation and made him appear far more popular than he was on the island. Matthews articles dignified Castros image, giving him credibility both at home and abroad and helping propel his rise to power. Upon Castros success of establishing a revolutionary socialist state in 1959, Castro claimed in New York City his ""greatest ploy"" was fooling Matthews. Castro admitted he only had 20 men left at the time of Matthews publications but convinced Matthews he had control of a huge army. Matthews observations backed this as he wrote, ""from the look of things, General Batista cannot possibly hope to suppress the Castro revolt."" In 2017, the New York Times published a series of articles praising the legacy of communism, which has killed at least 100 million people.",['Wendell Husebø'],7/12/2021 15:45,NYT on Cuba Protests: 'Freedom' Is an 'Anti-Government Slogan',"['slogans', 'matthews', 'protests', 'castro', 'cuba', 'freedom', 'antigovernment', 'popular', 'reported', 'nyt', 'york', 'times', 'protesters', 'slogan']","The New York Times described chants of ""freedom!"" at thousands-strong peaceful protests in Cuba on Sunday as one of several ""anti-government slogans"" popular among the congregated.

53,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-police-leave-ap-photographer-bloody-after-public-beating/,"Communist Party security forces in Cuba brutally assaulted an Associated Press photographer and several other international journalists attempting to cover protests against the regime on Sunday, leaving them visibly injured. Beginning Sunday morning, thousands of Cubans spontaneously gathered in at least 20 cities across the island to protest the communist regime, waving American flags and chanting ""freedom."" Havana has responded with brutal methods to suppress the demonstrators, using police force and evidently, live rounds, the discharge of which protesters have filmed. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, Raul Castros public figurehead, called for street ""combat"" against the agitators in a bellicose Sunday speech. ""We are willing to give our lives. They will have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution,"" he said. ""The order of combat is issued, revolutionaries to the streets."" Reportedly beginning in San Antonio de los Banos, a town in the islands West, Facebook livestreams of protesters shouting ""down with communism!"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" prompted nationwide outbursts of anti-regime expressions. The regimes violent suppression of the demonstrators has spread to journalists documenting their activities. Associated Press (AP) reporter Ramon Espinosa appeared in graphic photos from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) in which Cuban authorities attempt to restrain Espinosa. He was photographing the Havana protests. Subsequent photos depicted Espinosa, visibly injured, with blood covering his face from his eyes to his chin. Dark lines underscored his left eye and blood trickled from his nostrils, indicating he sustained multiple blows to the head between photos. Faced with considerable police violence, the demonstrators themselves have begun to speak of armed uprising. Following police gunfire in El Cerro, Havana, on Monday morning, an anonymous Cuban youth told ADN Cuba that unarmed demonstrators are helpless against the communist forces -- ""Sin armas somos un pastel para las moscas"" -- ""without weapons, we are a pastry for the flies."" ""We need weapons, something, I dont know,"" he continued. He was nonetheless resolute, saying ""we are going to give it all we have!"" Journalists and eyewitnesses in Camaguey, in Cubas rural center, saw protesters fight back against police gunfire by throwing rocks and overturning police cars.",['Ben Whedon'],7/12/2021 15:57,Cuba: Police Leave AP Photographer Bloody After Public Beating,"['visibly', 'leave', 'weapons', 'bloody', 'communist', 'cuban', 'ap', 'beating', 'regime', 'cuba', 'press', 'photographer', 'espinosa', 'demonstrators', 'public', 'photos', 'protesters']","Communist Party security forces in Cuba brutally assaulted an Associated Press photographer and several other international journalists attempting to cover protests against the regime on Sunday, leaving them visibly injured.

54,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2021/07/12/joe-bidens-cuba-statement-doesnt-mention-beatings-shootings-of-protesters/,"President Joe Biden issued a statement on Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people"" against their repressive communist regime but failing to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" the statement said, ignoring that bystanders recorded sounds of heavy gunfire and public beatings of dissidents. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime,"" the statement continued. Bidens comments are a response to an outpouring of opposition to the 62-year-old Castro regime on Sunday, attracting thousands of protesters nationwide. The protesters chanted slogans against the communist dictatorship to demand the end of communism in Cuba and shouted ""freedom"" - a fact lost on American mainstream outlets falsely claiming the protests were a response to the nations handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Videos from the island depict state security officers clothed in official and non-official uniforms attacking peaceful protesters. Breitbart News reported Monday bystanders in Havana heard sounds of gunfire and beatings of protestors, while ""President"" Diaz-Canel called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime.

People demonstrate, some holding Cuban and US National flags and placards, during a protest against the Cuban government in Miami on July 11, 2021.. (AFP) Cuba has blamed a US ""policy of economic suffocation"" for unprecedented anti-government protests, as US President Joe Biden backed called to end ""decades of repression"" on the communist island. Thousands of Cubans took part in demonstrations on Sunday, chanting: ""Down with the dictatorship,"" as President Miguel Diaz-Canel urged supporters to confront demonstrators. The anti-government rallies erupted spontaneously in several cities as the country endures its worst economic crisis in 30 years, with chronic shortages of electricity and food. Diaz-Canel on Monday blamed the uprising on the United States pursuing a ""policy of economic suffocation to provoke social unrest in the country."" READ MORE: Rare anti-government protests in Cuba as pandemic stirs emotions Biden calls on Cuba to 'hear' protesters Biden urged Cuba's communist government to ""hear"" protesters demanding an end to ""repression"" and poverty. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" The strongly-worded statement was sure to anger Cuba's leaders, who say Washington is stirring up the rare mass street protests in the authoritarian country. The Biden administration -- focused on domestic challenges including battling Covid-19 and passing infrastructure legislation, while also withdrawing from the 20-year war in Afghanistan -- has largely ignored Cuba until now. But the island has significant weight on US politics, with Cuban Americans a formidable presence in the important electoral state of Florida.

Police used tear gas to disperse crowds, and at least ten people were arrested, while officers used plastic pipes to beat protesters, AFP journalists witnessed. US-Cuba relations have been particularly fraught since then-president Donald Trump reinforced the blockade following a historic but temporary easing of tensions under Barack Obama between 2014 and 2016. The tougher measures, left unchanged by Biden, and the effects of the coronavirus epidemic contributed to Cuba's economy declining 11 percent in 2020. Public anger in the one-party state has been growing, driven by long food lines, worsening power shortages and a critical shortage of medicines.

""People are helping to spread awareness on the impact of COVID-19 in Cuba as cases hit an all-time high in the country,"" Twitter said of the #SOSCuba hashtag. But while the #SOSCuba hashtag was trending, Cubans were protesting their communist government, chanting, ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""We want liberty,"" while waving American flags. Social media users quickly pointed out the inaccuracy behind Twitters description of the #SOSCuba hashtag. ""Excuse me @Twitter #PatriaYVida has nothing to do with Covid19, it has everything to do with ending the repression in Cuba. #SosCuba is about freedom for a country that has been enslaved for over 60 years,"" tweeted former Florida mayoral candidate Esteban Bovo.

Thousands of Cubans have taken to the streets to lash out at the worsening economic and health conditions under the autocratic leftist government. President Biden released a statement saying the United States stands with the Cuban people and called for the ""Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" CUBANS PROTESTING COMMUNISM WITH AMERICAN FLAG BECAUSE ITS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM: REP GIMENEZ Meanwhile, a few fellow Democrats parroted Cubas communist governments talking points and blamed the U.S. for the suffering of the Cuban people rather than the communist government. Many called on President Biden to end the decades-long embargo on the country. ""The Cuban people suffer doubly from a repressive government and a cruel US embargo. They deserve policies that empower them and help them improve their lives,"" former senior advisor to President Obama and MSNBC contributor Ben Rhodes tweeted. Allen Glines and Shahid Buttar, both Democrats running for Congress, called for an end to the embargo. Buttar went further and added that Cubans ""enjoy"" more rights that Americans are denied like healthcare and housing. California Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna also called for an end to the U.S. embargo but also added that ""Cubas dictatorship must not interfere with peaceful protests."" Progressive reporters from outlets like NPR, Al Jazeera, The Nation, and The New Republic echoed Rhodes sentiment that the U.S. is to blame for poor economic conditions in Cuba. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Critics of the U.S. embargo of Cuba failed to mention that food and medicine are routinely exempted. Julie Chung, now acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, tweeted last year that the U.S. ""routinely authorizes the export of humanitarian goods, agricultural products, medicine, and medical equipment to support the Cuban people.""",['Andrew Kugle'],7/12/2021 16:44,"Reporters, Democrats blame US embargo for protests, poor conditions in Cuba","['running', 'reporters', 'embargo', 'end', 'called', 'states', 'rhodes', 'communist', 'poor', 'conditions', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'blame', 'democrats', 'routinely', 'united']","Some reporters and Democratic candidates running for Congress blamed the United States embargo of Cuba as the reason for the recent protests against the communist regime there.

Protesters said the 62-year-old communist authoritarian political systems inability to deal with the public health and economic crisis has resulted in lives lost. There is a shortage of food, medicines, and COVID-19 vaccines.

Social media users hoped the plea for help from different Cuban cities Sunday would reach the international community. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel responded Monday morning by saying the ""Cuban-American mafia"" had paid ""influencers."" Diaz-Canel didnt mention Lebanese-American Sarah Joe Chamoun, better known as porn star Mia Khalifa, by name. He did say that it appeared like ""a certain artist with certain characteristics"" was ""pressured"" into saying that he was a tyrant. In tweets directed to his account, she hurled insulting expletives at him. Ad ""This government is not afraid. We are full of energy, we are full of enthusiasm although it hurts ... It is hard what we are going through but we are convinced that we are going to face it and we are going to win,"" Diaz-Canel said in Spanish. Witnesses said Cuban police officers in civilian clothes were watching protesters. Some were armed with guns, baseball bats and rocks. Protesters said Cuban authorities also caused internet outages to prevent videos and photos of the historic protests from being distributed around the world.

The difficulties, Diaz-Canel said, came just as the island was feeling the effects of former President Donald Trump's sanctions. Some Cuban officials said during the news conference that enforcing the U.S. embargo during the pandemic is ""genocide."" A public health official touted scientists on the island developed several COVID vaccines including the three-shot Abdala. The Mambisa and the Soberanas vaccines remain under development and there is an ongoing study in Camaguey, a Cuban official said during the news conference. Protesters in Havana didnt share the Cuban government health officials pride. Witnesses videos show there were acts of vandalism against police during the historic demonstration of discontent. Protesters met in front of Cubas Communist Party headquarters where The Associated Press reported officers detained about 20 protesters. Ad Protesters who want democracy in Cuba said they want the freedom to elect a new government and put an end to the one-party system. In turn, government officials asked Cubans who support the communist revolution to go out to the streets and ""fight."" Cuba's people continue to bravely express yearning for freedom in the face of repression. We call on Cuba's govt to: Refrain from violence. Listen to their citizens demands. Respect protestor & journalist rights.

59,https://nypost.com/2021/07/12/democrats-and-republicans-divided-on-cuban-protest-response/,"The Biden administration and other prominent Democrats have been slow to respond to the ongoing protests against Cubas communist regime, while Republican politicians - many of them based in Florida - have sent messages of solidarity to the demonstrators. In a statement issued Monday, 24 hours after protesters first took to the streets, the White House said it supported ""the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" the statement read. ""Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" However, as images of the unrest were carried around the world on social media Sunday, the only statement from an administration official came via a tweet from Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Julie Chung. ""Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages,"" wrote Chung, who made no mention of the islands totalitarian government. ""We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki seemed to waffle Monday on the question of whether the protests were related to immediate events or if they reflected longstanding anger. ""There is every indication that yesterdays protests were spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban governments economic mismanagement and repression and these are protests inspired by the harsh reality of everyday life in Cuba,"" she said. Psaki declined to give a direct response when asked whether the Biden administration supports protesters using the American flag as a symbol of their struggle for freedom, saying only that ""the president certainly respects the symbol of the American flag"" and adding that while Biden displays it at his home, he ""also believes people have the right to peaceful protest."" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the son of Cuban immigrants, did issue a statement of his own Sunday that trumpeted a ""historic day of protests"". ""For decades, Cubas dictatorship has used violence and repression to silence its people, rather than permit the free exercise of democracy and their basic social rights,"" Menendez wrote. ""This must end. The worlds eyes are on Cuba tonight and the dictatorship must understand we will not tolerate the use of brute force to silence the aspirations of the Cuban people. ""As Ive said over the years, no one wishes that the reality in Cuba was more different than the Cuban people and Cuban-Americans that have fled the island in search of freedom,"" the senator added. ""Let us hear their voices. Listen to their cries of desperation. Support their demands by ensuring we do not perpetuate the regimes decades of repression."" Cuban demonstrators in Madrid, Spain, protest outside the Spanish lower chamber to ask the Cuban government to ""not violently suppress the peaceful rallies in Cuba."" FERNANDO VILLAR/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), tweeted her support for the Cuban protesters Monday, saying: ""The call for freedom and basic rights by the people of Cuba peacefully taking to the streets and marching is an act of great courage. I support the Cuban people in their pursuit of liberty and condemn any violence or targeting of those exercising their rights."" Two of the most prominent socialist members of Congress, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), had yet to make any comment on the situation as of Monday afternoon. Sanders caused outrage while running for president in February of 2020 when he told ""60 Minutes"" that it was ""unfair to simply say everything is bad"" about the Cuban regime. ""When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program,"" Sanders said. ""Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?"" Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday that ""I stand with the Cuban people 100% in their fight for freedom. ""The Government must let them speak and be free!"" Trump added. ""Joe Biden MUST stand up to the Communist regime or--history will remember. The Cuban people deserve freedom and human rights! THEY ARE NOT AFRAID! Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that ""people in Cuba are protesting 62 years of socialism lies, tyranny and misery, not 'expressing concerns about...COVID.'"" REUTERS The 45th president also said that ""Biden and the Democrats campaigned on reversing my very tough stance on Cuba. Remember when Obama attended baseball games with Castros while they imprisoned, beat, and killed the Cuban people."" Other Republican lawmakers spend Sunday cheering on the protesters and criticizing the Biden administrations relative silence. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) blasted Chungs statement as ""ridiculous."" ""People in #Cuba are protesting 62 years of socialism, lies, tyranny & misery not expressing concern about rising COVID cases/deaths,"" he tweeted. ""Why is it so hard for [Biden] & the people in his administration to say that?"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), also put Chung on blast. ""No theyre chanting LIBERTAD,"" he said. ""Stop playing cover for communists and support the Cuban people. My god. Why is that so hard for you?"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, reacting to massive anti-Havana demonstrations in that city, tweeted that ""I have never felt such raw emotion from the people of Miami desperate for intervention by the government and by themselves on behalf of Cuba. This is the moment for freedom in Cuba. IT CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER!"" In an earlier tweet, Suarez posted an image of himself speaking at one of the Miami demonstrations and added: ""The Cuban regimes military police are shooting at unarmed Cuban protestors fighting for freedom. 60 years of communism, cruelty, & oppression cannot last any longer! We are imploring the USA to take action as we peacefully demonstrate on the streets of Miami."" Suarez added the hashtag ""PATRIAYVIDA"" (""Homeland and life""), the rallying cry of the protesters Government supporters gather at the Maximo Gomez monument in Havana, Cuba, during a counter-protest. AP ""The United States needs to stand firm with the brave Cuban people as they protest the Castro regime and its years of oppression and communism,"" Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) told the Post. ""Instead of ignorantly blaming the protests on COVID as some Administration officials have, Joe Biden needs to be vocal in support and take action as they fight for freedom, opportunity and liberty."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) tweeted: ""After decades of suffering through a communist dictatorship, the Cuban people deserve liberty. I am proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Cuba who are calling out for freedom."" Cuba President Miguel Diaz-Canel alleged Monday that the protests were stirred up on social media by Cuban-Americans in the US. As of Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram in an apparent response to the protest, according to Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba has the ability to cut it off if it wants to.

Hundreds of demonstrators went out to the streets in several cities in Cuba to protest against ongoing food shortages and high prices of foodstuffs, amid the new coronavirus crisis. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) HAVANA (AP) -- Large contingents of Cuban police patrolled the capital of Havana on Monday following rare protests around the island nation against food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis. Cubas president said the demonstrations were stirred up on social media by Cuban Americans in the United States. Sundays protests marked some of the biggest displays of antigovernment sentiment in the tightly controlled country in years. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trumps administration. Many young people took part in demonstrations in Havana. Protests were also held elsewhere on the island, including in the small town of San Antonio de los Banos, where people objected to power outages and were visited by President Miguel Diaz-Canel. He entered a few homes, where he took questions from residents. Authorities appeared determined to put a stop to the demonstrations. More than a dozen protesters were detained, including a leading Cuban dissident who was arrested trying to attend a march in the city of Santiago, 559 miles (900 kilometers) east. The demonstrators disrupted traffic in the capital for several hours until some threw rocks and police moved in and broke them up. ADVERTISEMENT Internet service was spotty, possibly indicating an effort to prevent protesters from communicating with each other. ""Weve seen how the campaign against Cuba was growing on social media in the past few weeks,'' Diaz-Canel said Monday in a nationally televised appearance in which his entire Cabinet was also present. ""Thats the way its done: Try to create inconformity, dissatisfaction by manipulating emotions and feelings."" In a statement Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden said Cuban protesters were asserting their basic rights. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime,'' Biden said. The U.S. urges the Cuban government to serve their people rather than enriching themselves,'' Biden added. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq on Monday stressed the U.N. position ""on the need for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be respected fully, and we expect that that will be the case."" The demonstrations were extremely unusual on an island where little dissent against the government is tolerated. The last major public demonstration of discontent, over economic hardship, took place nearly 30 years in 1994. Last year, there were small demonstrations by artists and other groups, but nothing as big or widespread as what erupted this past weekend. In the Havana protest on Sunday, police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted, ""Freedom!"" ""Enough!"" and ""Unite!"" One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-age protester told The Associated Press. He declined to identify himself for fear of being arrested later. ADVERTISEMENT Later, about 300 pro-government protesters arrived with a large Cuban flag, shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. Some assaulted an AP videojournalist, smashing his camera. AP photojournalist Ramon Espinosa was then beaten by a group of police officers in uniforms and civilian clothes; he suffered a broken nose and an eye injury. The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages. People standing on many balconies along the central artery in the Centro Habana neighborhood applauded the protesters passing by. Others joined in the march. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon Sunday. On Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, said Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm. ""This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,"" he said. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba has the ability to cut it off if it wants to.",['Andrea Rodriguez'],7/12/2021 17:28,Police patrol Havana in large numbers after rare protests,"['numbers', 'havana', 'president', 'patrol', 'protest', 'large', 'cuban', 'ap', 'protests', 'rare', 'cuba', 'shortages', 'demonstrations', 'crisis', 'protesters']","Plainclothes police detain an anti-government protester during a protest in Havana, Cuba, Sunday, July 11, 2021.

61,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-slams-bidens-initial-comments-blaming-cuba-protests-on-covid-cases-as-a-major-failure,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is criticizing President Bidens administration for its initial diagnosis on the causes of mass protests that broke out in Cuba on Sunday. In a statement provided to Fox News, Rubio said more than 60 years of ""socialist dictatorship and oppression, as well as extraordinary courage from the Cuban people, have led to this historic moment."" His message was at odds with the State Department, which initially tied the historic protests in Cuba to COVID-19 concerns rather than the countrys communist government. Rubio slammed that charge - as well as the presidents silence over the weekend - as a ""major failure."" ""Now more than ever, the Cuban people need our support as they fight for their freedom,"" Rubio said. SANDERS LOVES TRASHING REPUBLICANS BUT WON'T CONDEMN TRULY OPPRESSIVE CUBAN COMMUNISTS Fox News reached out to the State Department which referred to a statement by President Biden on Monday praising Cuban protesters for issuing a ""clarion call for freedom and relief"" and called on the Cuban government to allow for peaceful protests. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" the president continued, adding that those rights, ""including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected."" ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves,"" Biden said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, meanwhile, sought to frame the protests being driven by far broader frustration, calling the demonstrations ""spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban governments economic mismanagement and repression."" DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS IGNORE CUBAN PROTESTERS RAILING AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP She added that the U.S. remains ready to assist Cuba in its COVID-19 vaccination effort, but the Cuban governments decision not to participate in COVAX - a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to poorer nations - complicated the effort. ""We certainly recognize and understand that access to vaccines is one of the issues that a number of individuals on the streets is voicing concern about, but we have to determine what the mechanism would be to work with the Cuban people to get vaccines to them,"" Psaki said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Later Monday, Rubio sent Biden a letter saying that the current protests in Cuba ""are not just about current economic shortages"" but about ""longstanding and deliberate actions taken by the dictatorship to stymy the economic prosperity and political freedom of the Cuban people."" In his letter, Rubio provided President Biden with six steps his administration ought to take to support the Cuban people.

62,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/12/cuba-protests-economic-crisis-president-miguel-diaz-canel,"The Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has attacked the ""shameful delinquents"" he claimed were trying to ""fracture"" his countrys communist revolution after the Caribbean island witnessed its largest anti-government protests in nearly three decades. As Cuban officials blamed the US for Sundays demonstrations, Joe Biden called on the islands leaders to hear its citizens ""clarion call for freedom"". ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" Biden said in a statement. In a televised address on Monday morning Diaz-Canel, who recently succeeded Raul Castro as the Communist partys top figure, painted the protests as part of a United States-backed, social media-driven plot to stir up public discontent and overthrow the Cuban regime. ""The approach wasnt peaceful yesterday,"" the 61-year-old politician claimed, criticising the ""completely vulgar"" behaviour of some demonstrators who he accused of throwing rocks at police and destroying cars. Diaz-Canel conceded other protesters had legitimate concerns over food shortages and blackouts, although he blamed those problems on US sanctions. ""Its legitimate to feel dissatisfaction,"" the partys powerful first secretary said in the broadcast. Rogelio Polanco Fuentes, a top party official who runs its ideology department, denounced the protests as part of a well-funded US-sponsored effort to create ""instability and chaos"" in Cuba, which is currently experiencing its worst economic slump in decades as well as a worsening Covid crisis. Polanco Fuentes compared Sundays protests to the failed US-backed uprising against Venezuelas authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, in 2019. ""We are living through new chapters of the non-conventional war ... in other places they have called these Colour Revolutions ... or soft coups,"" Polanco said. Cuban dissidents rejected those claims about the protests which rippled across Cuba on Sunday, with thousands taking to the streets to denounce the lack of medicine and food and the lack of political freedoms. By Sunday afternoon the demonstrations had reached one of Cubas most iconic locations: the seafront Malecon in the capital Havana where thousands of protesters were seen chanting ""homeland and life"" and ""freedom"". The Malecon promenade was the setting of Cubas last significant street demonstrations, a sudden and short-lived explosion of dissent in 1994 known as the ""Maleconazo Uprising"". ""What is happening is absolutely historical for us ... I think this is a point of no return. Things will never be there same after this,"" said Carolina Barrero, a 34-year-old Havana-based activist. ""We are talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of people, all across the island. In every little town there was protest, [it was] completely spontaneous. ""They were shouting: 'We dont have fear any more! 'We want freedom! and 'Abajo la dictadura! (Down with the dictatorship!)"" added Barrero, an art historian who said she had recently been placed under house arrest after being detained reading a poem outside Cubas culture ministry. Paul Hare, the former British ambassador in Havana, said Cubas leaders would be concerned by the highly unusual eruption of dissent, and particularly how it had been organized with the help of social media. Word of the protests spread rapidly on Sunday, as celebrities and influencers shared news of the marches using the hashtag #SOSCuba. ""What Cubas government has always dreaded is a coordinated movement, as opposed to sporadic protests ... They see it as the possible genesis of an organized rival political movement,"" Hare said. ""The hardliners will be saying: 'Be careful - this could get out of hand ... They will be worried [about the protests]. It is a sign that the Communist party is no longer able to vertically dictate what policy should be,"" Hare added. Cuban activists said they were unimpressed with Diaz-Canels initial response to their demands, and particularly his call on Sunday for ""revolutionaries"" to hit the streets to confront protesters provocations ""with firmness and bravery"". ""What worries me the most is how they are trying to lay the ground for a wave of repression,"" said Claudia Genlui Hidalgo, a 30-year-old dissident who saw several friends arrested on Sunday. ""When he says 'revolutionaries to the street, hes inciting violence."" Barrero said she hoped the protests would lead to a peaceful transition away from one-party rule but was also troubled by the possibility of conflict and by Diaz-Canels description of the protests as ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"". Hare predicted there would now be a political crackdown on those identified as protest ringleaders as Communist party security chiefs fought to prevent a repeat. World leaders reacted to Cubas unexpected convulsion on Monday with Mexicos president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, saying he hoped a peaceful resolution could be reached ""without the use of force, without confrontation and without violence"". ""The Cubans must decide [the solution] because Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation - there must be no interventionism,"" Lopez Obrador added. A spokesperson for Russias foreign ministry also cautioned against ""outside interference"" that sought to ""encourage the destabilization"" of the communist-run island.","['Tom Phillips', 'Ed Augustin']",7/12/2021 17:45,Cuban president claims protests part of US plot to 'fracture' Communist party,"['party', 'peaceful', 'president', 'leaders', 'claims', 'communist', 'cuban', 'thousands', 'protests', 'cubas', 'fracture', 'political', 'protesters', 'plot']","The Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has attacked the ""shameful delinquents"" he claimed were trying to ""fracture"" his countrys communist revolution after the Caribbean island witnessed its largest anti-government protests in nearly three decades.

63,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-backs-cuban-protests-islands-president-blames-imperialist/story?id=78798057,"President Joe Biden on Monday stood in solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who protested over the weekend about shortages and rising prices for food and medicine amid the coronavirus pandemic in what's being called an unprecedented rejection of the island nation's government. Biden, speaking to reporters at a White House meeting Monday, addressed what he called ""the remarkable protests"" in Cuba of people ""demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime."" ""And I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- if, quite frankly, ever. And the United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights, and we call on the government, the government of Cuba, to refrain from violence and their attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba,"" he said. Cuba's communist leadership has already denounced the protests as a ""systemic provocation"" by Cuban dissidents and the U.S. government, encouraged its supporters to counter-protest, and sent its armed forces into the streets, risking clashes with demonstrators. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden said, ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime."" ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves,"" he said. Sunday's protests, in several cities across the island, are some of the biggest anti-government demonstrations in Cuba's recent history, and Biden had been called on to show support for the protests. While he helped the Obama administration's efforts to ease tensions with Cuba and reopen trade and travel, Biden has kept most of former President Donald Trump's sanctions and restrictions in place on America's close neighbor and longtime adversary. The administration says it is still reviewing its Cuba policy, earning the ire of progressives in the Democratic Party, but with these nearly unprecedented demonstrations, it may have to move more quickly than it hoped. So far, the administration has voiced support for the Cuban people's right to peacefully assemble and condemned any violence. Prior to Biden's statement, acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Julie Chung and Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan weighed in with that sentiment. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged public grievances over blackouts and food and medicine shortages during a televised address Monday, but he blamed the island nation's problems on the long-standing U.S. embargo and accused American ""imperialists"" of stoking tensions on social media. ""Yesterday, Cuba lived the most heroic day. Thousands of patriotic people defend the Revolution,"" he said on state television, referring to pro-government demonstrations in Havana later on Sunday that numbered around 300, according to the Associated Press. ""We do not want to hurt our beloved people,"" added Diaz-Canel, who assumed the presidency in 2019 and became the first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party this April, officially taking over for Raul Castro. Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla had even sharper words Monday, firing back at Sullivan and Chung's statements of support for protests by saying the White House has ""no political or moral authority to speak about Cuba."" ""His government has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to promote subversion in our country & implements a genocidal blockade, which is the main cause of economic scarcities,"" he tweeted, referring directly to Sullivan's statement. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, with its economy contracting by double-digits last year. But along with the economic crisis, the country is dealing with another deadly surge of COVID-19. ABC News' Christine Theodorou and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.","['Abc News', 'Conor Finnegan', 'July']",7/12/2021 18:22,Biden backs Cuban protests as island's president blames 'imperialist' provocations,"['president', 'rights', 'islands', 'right', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'imperialist', 'economic', 'provocations', 'backs', 'blames']","Biden, speaking to reporters at a White House meeting Monday, addressed what he called ""the remarkable protests"" in Cuba of people ""demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime.""

Suarez, whose father Xavier was the city's first Cuban-born mayor, told ""Your World"" guest host Sandra Smith on Monday that it is unbelievable that anyone would fail to condemn Communist ideology. ""[It] has failed not just in Cuba but in the history of humanity--this is an ideology that promises to create equality. The only equality it has delivered is equal misery for all of its citizens in every country that its been tried,"" he said. ""It's time for the United States to understand that. It's time for us to understand this could affect American cities if we're not careful."" Suarez added that socialism provides people a ""false promise"" and in practice means the government takes away peoples' property and freedoms. ""The truth of the matter is, it's never worked and never going to work and the United States has to start intervening and finding a way, whether it's through humanitarian aid, military intervention, whatever means necessary to protect the sovereignty of the Cuban people and the sovereignty of the United States in this hemisphere,"" he said. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, who is also head of the Communist Party, released a statement that warned the ""Cuban Revolution is not going to turn the other cheek to those who attack it in virtual and real spaces,"" and that his government will ""avoid revolutionary violence, but will repress counterrevolutionary violence."" Suarez said the communist regime is a ""drug-trafficking dictatorship"" that sponsors terrorism and exports its dangerous political system throughout the world. ""And so, it affects U.S. interests. That's something that sometimes is not emphasized enough: How this affects U.S. National security policy,"" he said. ""And I think the U.S. has to understand that these kinds of regimes that are enslaving not just Cubans, but Nicaraguans and Venezuelans... impact our sovereignty and our security."" ""The U.S. has a vested interest and a right to intervene on behalf of the Cuban people but also on behalf of the United States and creating an international coalition is important,"" he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mayor referenced Fox News correspondent Phil Keating's report outside Versailles, a famous Cuban restaurant on US-41 in Little Havana, where people waved Cuban flags and shouted pro-democracy slogans. ""The Cuban people have no food, as was stated by [Keating]. They have no access to medical care, particularly being devastated by the coronavirus and most importantly they want freedom. What we have in this country, they want the hope for a better future,"" Suarez said.",['Charles Creitz'],7/12/2021 18:30,"Miami mayor blasts far-left silence on Cuban protests, says crisis exposes fallacy of socialism","['farleft', 'states', 'socialism', 'told', 'communist', 'fox', 'cuban', 'crisis', 'protests', 'suarez', 'exposes', 'understand', 'united', 'silence', 'miami', 'mayor', 'fallacy', 'sovereignty']","Miami Republican Mayor Francis Suarez called out the far-left's silence over the pro-democracy protests in Cuba, which has been ruled by decades of Communist dictatorship, and told Fox News the latest unrest exposes the ""false promise"" of socialism.

The Republican Partys rising star posted on Twitter sharing a video of the protests, which took place throughout the island and news outlets estimate attracted thousands of people: Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana. The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies #SOSCuba Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana.

DeSantis passed the bill in response to Black Lives Matter protests that devolved into violence and looting in major cities across the nation last summer. Notably, Black Lives Matter was founded by ""trained Marxists."" Marxism is the philosophical underpinning of communism, the ruling political system in Cuba, and has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people over several decades, as Breitbart News reported. Unlike the Cuba protests on Sunday, the assemblies the DeSantis bill targets would involve violence on the part of participants, including vandalism, looting, and property destruction. Democrats appear to argue that DeSantis was being hypocritical by supporting peaceful protesters in Cuba while attempting to crack down on violent riots in the United States. ""Says the Governor who pushed through House Bill 1, a bill motivated as a means to silence racial justice protests,"" State Rep. Anna V. Eskamani (D) tweeted. ""I support the Cuban people as they take to the streets & let their voices be heard & do everything they cant do in Florida without it being labelled [sic] an 'aggravated riot under Ron Desantiss anti-protest law,"" State Rep. Omari Hardy (D) wrote. ""@GovRonDeSantis made this type of protest illegal in Florida. He wants to silence dissent because he fears accountability,"" tweeted Steve Simeonidis, who is the chair for Miami-Dade Democrats. In response to Simeonidis, Republican communicator and former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications deputy Matt Whitlock criticized Democrats rhetoric. He tweeted: Fascinating strategy from a number of Florida Dems. Instead of supporting protestors in Cuba, theyre trying to argue DeSantiss anti-rioting law wouldve prevented similar protests. It wouldnt have, but a good window into why theyre losing the voters theyre losing. Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) also re-tweeted DeSantis in support of Cuban protesters and warned of communisms insidious grasp in the United States. He posted: The same Communist rule the people of Cuba are valiantly protesting as we speak is the same Communism threatening to take hold in America today. May God protect the brave people protesting the tyrannical Cuban regime. May their long-awaited freedom prevail once & for all. President Joe Biden released a statement on Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people"" against their repressive communist regime. However, he failed to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security, Breitbart News reported. He also failed to condemn socialism and communism. The leftist New York Times, which played a direct role in Fidel Castros takeover of Cuba, also erroneously reported the protests were about ""food and medicine shortages,"" even though local independent outlets documented protesters chanting ""down with communism!"", ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"", among other anti-government statements. The protests appeared to begin in the town of San Antonio de los Banos, western Cuba, on Sunday morning. Locals livestreamed the protest on Facebook, triggering an outpouring into the streets of at least 16 major cities including both Havana and Santiago de Cuba, on opposite ends of the island, Breitbart News reported. So far, local outlets in Cuba are estimating hundreds of arrests. Bystanders recorded the sound of heavy gunfire in Havana and public beatings of dissidents. Miguel Diaz-Canel, the 'president appointed by Raul Castro, called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime in a speech on Sunday.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/12/2021 18:47,Florida Democrats Condemn DeSantis over Cuba Protests,"['streets', 'havana', 'desantis', 'florida', 'cuban', 'regime', 'protests', 'cuba', 'democrats', 'condemn', 'silence', 'bill', 'protesters']","Florida Democrats responded to Governor Ron DeSantis (R) sending support to anti-communist protesters in Cuba on Sunday by attacking the governor, seemingly comparing his administration to the Castro regime.

(AP Photo/Eliana Aponte, file) Cubans facing the countrys worst economic crisis in decades took to the streets over the weekend. In turn, authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation. Restricting internet access has become a tried-and-true method of stifling dissent by authoritarian regimes around the world, alongside government-supported disinformation campaigns and propaganda. On the extreme side, regimes like China and North Korea exert tight control over what regular citizens can access online. Elsewhere, service blockages are more limited, often cutting off common social platforms around elections and times of mass protests. There was no formal organizer of Sundays protests; people found out about the rallying points over social media, mostly on Twitter and Facebook, the platforms most used by Cubans. The thousands of Cubans who took to the streets -- protesters and pro-government activists alike -- wielded smartphones to capture images and send them to relatives and friends or post them online. ADVERTISEMENT On Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, said Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm. ""This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,"" he said. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba could cut it off if it wants to. While the recent easing of access by Cuban authorities to the internet has increased social media activity, Toker said, the level of censorship has also risen. Not only does the cutoff block out external voices, he said, it also squelches ""the internal voice of the population who have wanted to speak out."" Internet access in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. The country was ""basically offline"" until 2008, then gradually entered a digital revolution, said Ted Henken, a Latin America expert at Baruch College, City University of New York. The biggest change, he noted, came in December 2018 when Cubans got access to mobile internet for the first time via data plans purchased from the state telecom monopoly. These days, more than half of all Cubans have internet access, Henken said. Many Cubans now have real-time, anywhere-you-are access to the internet and the ability to share information among themselves, he added. Since early 2019, this access has facilitated regular, if smaller, events and protests on the island. In response, the government has periodically shut down access to social media, mostly to hide its repressive tactics from both citizens and foreigners, he said. The Cuban government also restricts independent media in Cuba and ""routinely blocks access within Cuba to many news websites and blogs,"" according to Human Rights Watch. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. The protests now, the largest in decades, are ""absolutely and definitely fueled by increased access to internet and smartphones in Cuba,"" said Sebastian Arcos, associate director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. ADVERTISEMENT Social media posts from within and outside of Cuba are ""not the root causes of the rebellion, but they are a factor in connecting the desperation, disaffection that exists in the island,"" said Arturo Lopez-Levy, an assistant political science professor at Holy Names University in California. Lopez-Levy, who grew up a few blocks from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, said the countrys current leader has embraced the economic potential of digital technology far more than his predecessors, but may have calculated that a large segment of Cubans will accept a temporary internet shutdown if it helps restore order in the streets. Elsewhere, government internet shutdowns after or ahead of protests have also become commonplace, whether for a few hours or extending for months. In Ethiopia, there was a three-week shutdown in July 2020 after civil unrest. The internet blackout in the Tigray region has stretched on for months. In Belarus, the internet went down for more than two days after an August 2020 election seen as rigged sparked mass protests. Mobile internet service repeatedly went down during weekend protests for months afterwards. A decade ago during the Arab Spring, when social media was still in its early years and Egypt, Tunisia and other countries in the Middle East faced bloody uprisings that were broadcast on social media, headlines declared the movements ""Twitter Revolutions"" and experts debated about just how important a role social media played in the events. Ten years later, there is no question that social media and private chat platforms have become an essential organizing tool. Restricting them, in turn, is a routine move to suppress dissent. Internet service was disrupted in Cali, Colombia during May anti-government protests. This year has also seen disruptions in Armenia, Uganda, Iran, Chad, Senegal and the Republic of Congo. But authoritarian regimes arent the only ones getting into the act. India routinely shuts down the internet during times of unrest. Toker of NetBlocks said the imposition of internet restrictions in Cuba follows an emerging global pattern and not always in the countries you most expect them, such as a recent Nigerian cutoff of Twitter. On the plus side, he said, the world is much more aware of these incidents because its easier to monitor and report them remotely. On Sunday, all of Cuba went offline for less than 30 minutes, after which there were several hours of intermittent but large outages, said Doug Madory of Kentik, a network management company. He said large internet outages were very rare in Cuba until very recently. ""There was an outage in January just for mobile service following the '27N protests,"" Madory said, referring to a movement of Cuban artists, journalists and other members of civil society who marched on the Ministry of Culture on Nov. 27, 2020, demanding freedom and democracy. Henken said he doesnt believe the government would shut off access for an extended period of time, even though that is its go-to tactic for dissidents and activists. ""The problem they have now is that its not a handful of activists or artists or independent journalists -- its now a massive swath of the population all throughout the country,"" he said. ""So the genie is out of the bottle. Theyre trying to put it back in."" __ AP Havana correspondent Andrea Rodriguez and AP technology reporter Matt OBrien contributed to this article.","['Barbara Ortutay', 'Frank Bajak', 'Tali Arbel']",7/12/2021 19:15,Cuba's internet cutoff: A go-to tactic to suppress dissent,"['cutoff', 'media', 'decades', 'access', 'tactic', 'economic', 'cuban', 'dissent', 'internet', 'protests', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'social', 'cubas', 'goto', 'suppress']","In turn, authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation.

67,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/57-missing-imprisoned-cuba-protests-include-artists-peace-activists-priests/,"The Cuban pro-democracy group Cuba Decide confirmed the disappearance or arrest of 57 people since protests erupted throughout the island on Sunday night, many of them prominent critics of the communist regime. Cuba experienced a wave of protests nationwide on Sunday, affecting at least 20 localities from far-west Pinar del Rio to Santiago de Cuba, the capital of Oriente province. Reports estimate thousands took to the streets, chanting ""freedom,"" ""down with communism,"" and other anti-regime slogans. Authorities have not published any official estimates of the number of people protesting and the disparate events nationwide were not organized by any centralized group, so no true number of how many Cubans were on the streets exists. The Communist Party responded to the protests by calling for civil war, urging civilians to violently attack anyone participating in protests. ""This is why we are calling all the revolutionaries of our country, all the communists, to go to the streets anywhere that these provocations are happening today, from now on through all these days,"" Miguel Diaz-Canel, the president of the country and face of the Castro regime, said in a televised address late Sunday. Cuban civilians documented multiple instances throughout the country of state security agents firing live rounds into crowds and beating protesters with baseball bats and other weapons. Witnesses also documented the use of tear gas and other repressive anti-riot gear. Cuba Decide, which advocates for the replacement of the repressive Communist Party autocracy with an election-based democratic system, published the names Monday, stating these are only those whom they can confirm with certainty are missing or in police custody as of 10 a.m. local time Monday. Reporte actualizado con detenidos y/o desaparecidos, hasta las 10 am#SOSCuba pic.twitter.com/Fre0Do52qF -- CUBADECIDE (@CUBADECIDE) July 12, 2021 At the top of the list is a perennial target of Castro repression: Jose Daniel Ferrer, the head of the largest Cuban dissident organization, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU). While UNPACU has not taken credit for organizing any of these protests, it has laid the groundwork for years on exercising peaceful assembly on the island, often at the price of Ferrers arrest. Ferrer most recently disappeared in October 2019 after organizing an anti-communist protest the month before in commemoration of the feast day of Our Lady of Charity, the patroness saint of Cuba. He resurfaced in April 2020, having clearly endured torture at the hands of the regime and suffering from several health conditions that he was diagnosed with during his time in police custody. Police never justified to Ferrer or his family his extended stay in prison. Also missing at press time following the Sunday protests is Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, a Catholic priest who has spent years advocating for the end of authoritarianism in Cuba. Alvarez was one of three priests behind a famous 2018 letter to Raul Castro seeking free elections in Cuba and has used his position as a clergyman to urge a peaceful transition out of communism. Reports on Monday indicated that Cuban state security severely beat Alvarez in his native Camaguey, leaving him with a visible bloody head injury before his disappearance. The priests whereabouts remain unknown. Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, the often-arrested head of a Havana artist dissident group the San Isidro Movement, is also missing at press time. Oteros group was responsible for the largest recent protest in the country prior to this weekend: the storming of the Ministry of Culture in Havana in November. That assembly was in response, in part, to the violent arrest of another member of the San Isidro Movement, rapper Denis Solis, who received an eight-month prison sentence for the crime of ""disrespect"" against a police officer. The officer had entered his apartment illegally, prompting Solis to demand his removal from the premises. Solis filmed the encounter. Amid the dozens of protester disappearances, Cuban police released Solis on Monday. Many other San Isidro members appear on Cuba Decides list of the missing and in custody. The independent outlet 14 y Medio -- run by Cuban journalists on the island who routinely face arrest and persecution -- reported Monday that some neighborhoods of Cuba are experiencing door-to-door police raids. Authorities, it noted, began visiting residences in the early hours of Monday looking for people who participated in the protests to deprive them of their freedoms, eyewitnesses said. ""In my neighborhood they have already taken away two young people and I am waiting for them to come get me since I was at the protests,"" a young man in Artemisa, greater Havana, told the outlet on condition of anonymity. In Camaguey, where Father Alvarez disappeared, residents reported the widespread use on Sunday of ""special forces"" to contain protests, including state security troops firing at protesters and injuring an unknown number. Elsewhere in the country, police chose to attack journalists; one particularly gory exchange left Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosas face broken and bloodied. Other international photographers documented the gang beating of Espinosa with their cameras, at the hands of uniformed Cuban police.

The mass, spontaneous protests that broke out all over the country last weekend are yet another sign that the Cuban government lacks all legitimacy. In Cuba, it is the government versus the people, and lo, all these years, Castros apologists have been with the government. They have romanticized Fidel Castro, the founder father of Cubas junta. They have swallowed its propaganda. They have made excuses for it. They have looked away from its crimes. And they have blamed America for its manifest failures. If the protests continue in Cuba, there will be an existential struggle between people in the streets displaying American flags and chanting for freedom and an organized crime syndicate that rules by force and has long held the affection of American left. During his presidential campaign last year, Bernie Sanders wouldnt back off his supportive statements about the Castro regime over the years -- yes, the government should be less authoritarian, but it has done so much good. Filmmaker Michael Moore made a popular movie extolling the Cuban health-care system. Upon Fidels death in 2016, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his ""deep sorrow"" at the death of ""Cubas longest serving president"" (when a president jails his opponents, he can indeed stay in office a long time). Cubas regime has long benefited from the romantic image of violent Latin American revolutionaries (Che Guevara is a popular progressive mascot), the fact that it is a left-wing, rather than right-wing dictatorship, and that it has always fed off Anti-American sentiments. People protesting the Cuban government and President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on July 11, 2021 Photo by YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images The rationalizations offered for the regime are tinny and misleading. We are supposed to believe that Cuba was sunk in medieval illiteracy until enlightened Communists came to power who cared above all about social progress and just happened to jail, torture, and kill lots of people in the course of teaching kids to read. But its not true that Cuba was markedly illiterate prior to the advent of the Castro dictatorship; in 1960, the literacy rate was about 80 percent, among the highest in Latin America. Nor is it correct that Castro had benevolent intentions with his literacy campaign; the point was to make it easier to stuff the Cuban people with Communist propaganda. Finally, its wrong to presume that people can only learn to read if they are cowed into submission by Marxist thugs; other Latin American countries achieved massive increases in literacy without throwing people in gulags. Cuba was among the leaders in the region in terms of infant mortality and life expectancy -- two other supposed benefits of communism -- before the revolution. A man getting arrested during a demonstration in Havana, Cuba on July 11, 2021. Photo by YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images The economic historian Brad DeLong has noted that Cuba in 1957 had lower infant mortality than many European countries, more doctors and nurses per capita than Britain or Finland, and as many vehicles per capita as Italy or Portugal. After decades of Castros dictatorship, its per capita GDP ranks with Mongolia and Bhutan, according to CIA figures. This suggests, correctly, that Castro took over a country in pretty good shape and wrecked it, rather than the other way around. The governments failures are always blamed on the US embargo. If it werent for the US strictures, on this view, Cuba would be the one Marxist economy in the world able to deliver plenty to its people. Actually, shortages are endemic because of the inefficiencies inherent to command-and-control economies. The US embargo is unilateral, and the Cuban government has long been expert at evading it. There is nothing keeping Cuba from trading with other advanced Western countries and buying their goods, if the artificially impoverished country could afford them (its characteristic way of doing business is to buy on credit and then never pay up). All of this has always been plain enough, but now even more so. There is a revolutionary movement afoot in Cuba, one that is courageous, inspiring, and -- one hopes -- truly democratic. It is the ordinary people of Cuba attempting to vindicate their rights against the Lefts favorite dictatorship.

Menendez said, ""I think the president has had a time to review the actual policies under President Obama, and all of the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided, unilateral, in terms of concessions, showed themselves to create absolutely no change inside of Cuba. The regime still arrested peaceful protesters. The regime still put political dissidents in jail. The regime still rationed the Cuban people, even as they had dollar stores bursting with food, but the Cuban people could not get access to that unless they had access to dollars. So, the regime showed no change, but what it did do is profit dramatically by the revenues that flowed into the regime. Because the regime controls all tourism and all agriculture sales inside of Cuba."" He added, ""I dont think the administration should just return to the Obama policies, which showed themselves not to succeed in the aspirations that they had.""

72,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cruz-calls-out-bidens-state-department-amid-reports-of-cubas-crackdown-on-protesters,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Monday questioned an early tweet from the U.S. State Department that seemed to assure Americans that the right to peaceful assembly is observed in Cuba amid new reports of a punishing crackdown by the government and an emerging ""list of missing persons."" Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, posted a portion of an article from the Wall Street Journal that mentioned Cubas Communist governments effort to snuff out protests. Havana deployed security forces across the island and arrested dozens. Reuters reported that it appeared police -- many who were dressed in plain clothes -- were seen beating some demonstrators. ""How is this possible??"" Cruz tweeted. ""The Biden State Dept told us that the Cuban communist dictatorship protects their ""right to peaceful assembly""?"" Cruz referred to the much-maligned tweet sent out by the State Department on Sunday that read in part, ""Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly."" President Biden said in an earlier statement: ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime."" A spokesperson from the National Security Council said the Biden administration--including the State Department--has been ""consistent in its calls for the promotion of democracy and human rights in Cuba, including denouncing abuses by Cubas authoritarian regime and pushing for reforms."" The Journals report said the Cuban government essentially sealed off much of the countrys communication with the outside world and arrested more than 100 people. The report, citing activists, said that the whereabouts of many protesters are not known. The protests were seen as historic. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. The country also reported 7,000 daily COVID-19 infections on Sunday and 47 deaths. ""For the first time ever, authorities deployed anti-riot equipment,"" Angel Rodriguez, a human-rights activist in Havana, told the paper. ""Last night, police used rubber bullets and tear gas."" BIDEN PRAISES CUBAN PROTESTERS AFTER CUBA PRESIDENT ACCUSES US OF FUNDING DEMONSTRATORS The crackdown does not come as a surprise. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, showed no interest in addressing the protesters concerns. He used a televised address on Sunday night to urge revolutionaries to take to take to the streets and counter the anti-government protesters. BERNIE SANDERS DEFENDS FIDEL CASTRO'S SOCIALIST CUBA: 'UNFAIR TO SIMPLY SAY EVERYTHING IS BAD' Amnesty International posted about reports of a ""long list of missing persons"" stemming from the protests. GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Diaz-Canel government must address the social demands of its citizens, given the economic crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, the collapse of the health system - which is not responding to the current COVID-19 crisis - and the accumulation of historical demands for respect of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,"" a statement from the group read. The Associated Press contributed to this report",['Edmund Demarche'],7/13/2021 1:13,Cruz calls out Biden's State Department amid reports of Cuba's crackdown on protesters,"['peaceful', 'state', 'reports', 'cruz', 'right', 'amid', 'department', 'cuban', 'report', 'cuba', 'protests', 'cubas', 'calls', 'bidens', 'economic', 'crackdown', 'protesters']","Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, posted a portion of an article from the Wall Street Journal that mentioned Cubas Communist governments effort to snuff out protests.

73,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/13/alleged-witness-asks-florida-friend-to-let-world-know-police-brutality-followed-protest-in-havana/,"MIAMI - Vito LaNave said his friend in Cuba was panicking. The South Florida resident said his friend in Havana sent him text messages asking him to tell friends in Miami that Cuban police officers were arresting, beating, and killing unarmed civilians. LaNave, an 81-year-old New Yorker of Italian descent, said he made many Cuban friends while he was a member of an organization in Hialeah. He learned how to use an encrypted app to stay in touch with those who went back to Havana to be with family. Cuban officials did not report the alleged violence during a Monday news conference. On Sunday night, LaNave received text messages from a friend in Havana. ""My life and my familys could be at risk ... Things are getting out of hand here,"" his friend wrote, later adding, ""I have video of the government killing civilians ... Please, theyre killing us."" LaNave shared two videos he said were from witnesses of police brutality. He said witnesses who didnt participate in the protests were afraid to go public. LaNave said he told his friend to stay home and avoid speaking English because he could be wrongly accused of working for the U.S. government. Ad ""Its real bad. He is never in that much panic ... He said he witnessed a couple of people being shot,"" LaNave said. ""He said a policeman shot somebody in the head."" LaNave said there are more witness videos, but since the Cuban government disrupted internet connections it has been impossible to ""smuggle out the videos."" Patrick Oppmann, CNNs Havana-based correspondent, said locals know the government shuts down the internet to shut up critics, but Cuban officials havent talked about the tactic. Confirmed: Social media and messaging platforms disrupted in #Cuba from Friday to Monday on state-run internet provider #Cubacel; network data corroborate reports of outages amid protests for artistic freedom in #Havana; incident duration ~3 days   https://t.co/JOKfRpfe8D pic.twitter.com/XoqU2pOOTF -- NetBlocks (@netblocks) November 30, 2020 Andy Gomez, a retired professor of Cuban studies at the University of Miami, and other experts said the governments repression after the protest is not surprising. ""They dont want the images that we saw yesterday being shown around the world,"" said Gomez, the former dean of international studies at UM. LaNave said his friend in Havana also told him that he is pretty certain there are foreign nationals working with Cuban police. He told him there are witnesses who said some of the officers who were dressed as civilians had ""strong"" accents. Ad ""Russians! He saw how they looked! He said it sounded like they were Russian,"" LaNave said. Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, of the Cuban Democratic Directorate, a Miami-based organization that advocates for democracy in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, said he fears Russians and Chinese agents will help Cuban police officers enforce a violent crackdown. ""We are asking for the international community led by the United States to intervene, to protect the Cuban people from a bloodbath,"" Gutierrez-Boronat said during a news conference Monday in Miami-Dade County.  CUBA !! Massive police violence has been reported amid nationwide protests against the socialist regime#SOSMatanzasCuba #SOSCuba pic.twitter.com/3SF7pkug3T -- Newsistaan (@newsistaan) July 12, 2021 Gomez and Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University, agreed with Gutierrez-Boronat, who earned a doctorate from UM on the philosophy of international studies. Ad ""It seems difficult, or unlikely on the surface that things would continue at kind of the pace they did yesterday given that government security forces are clearly out in force,"" Bustamante said. LaNave said the violence and fear his friends are experiencing needs a response from Americans who care about human rights. He said Cuba has a special place in his heart. ""Havana was the paradise of North America in the late 1950s,"" LaNave said. Before communism took hold, LaNave said he and his friends used to take a bus from New York to Florida. He said they traveled to Key West where they would hop on a ferry to enjoy the nightlife in Havana. ""Out of Key West, there were two or three ferry boats. You would drive your car right onto the ferry and when you got to Cuba you drove it off,"" LaNave said. ""Everybody went to the Tropicana. It was loaded with Americans and Europeans. Its was like Las Vegas."" Ad LaNave said he traveled to Cuba again when Americans were allowed back to the island. His friends had warned him the glitz had faded and the patina had turned into ruin. Still, he said he was shocked to see how empty the stores were. ""I saw the desperation in peoples faces,"" said LaNave, who has a practice as a life coach. LaNave said he met his Cuban friends relatives. He said he met an underpaid surgeon who was going to work on a bicycle and a physician who was hitchhiking to work. He has thought about them during the coronavirus pandemic. ""It was a shame the amount of suffering and pain that these people were at because they wouldnt even look you in the eye,"" LaNave said, adding it was alarming to think that the situation had gotten any worst.

75,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/politics/biden-foreign-policy-cuba-haiti/index.html,"(CNN) President Joe Biden has staked his presidency on America's return -- a return to normalcy amid the coronavirus pandemic , a return to the global stage following four years of Trump-era isolationism and, arguably, a return to many of the policy positions adopted by the Obama administration. But recent incidents in the Caribbean mark a moment in which the Biden administration may be in uncharted territory. While issues related to Russia, China and the Northern Triangle have been at the forefront of the Biden administration's foreign policy priorities, violence and demonstrations taking place just off of America's coast have forced the White House's response. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was killed during an attack last week on his private residence in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's first lady, Martine Moise, was also shot in the attack and evacuated to a hospital in Miami for treatment. The assassination has left the nation in deeper turmoil, leaving a power vacuum and coming as Haiti has been dealing with a wave of extreme violence, a growing humanitarian crisis and a worsening Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. The dual crises come at a time when the President would rather be focusing his attention on domestic issues like infrastructure and voting rights, a subject on which he's set to give a major speech on Tuesday. When it comes to foreign affairs the White House has been preoccupied with the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and resetting American foreign policy to focus on powers in the Eastern Hemisphere like Russia and China. To a certain extent, the dealings with those nations are ones that previous administrations also had to figure out how to handle, but the issues bubbling up in the Caribbean will be among the first unique foreign crises to test Biden and his team. Biden on Monday indicated that the US is ""ready to provide assistance"" to both Cuba and Haiti, but it's unclear exactly what form that help will take. The Haitian government last week requested US troops to help protect infrastructure, ports, airports and energy systems, Elections Minister Mathias Pierre told CNN. Mathias said the request was for a limited number of around 500 troops and that he anticipated the threat to be ""potential mercenaries."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that request is still under review. A US delegation traveled to Haiti on Sunday at the Haitian government's request and that delegation briefed Biden on Monday morning after their return. The State Department disclosed Monday that they are aware of a third American citizen detained in Haiti after the assassination. CNN reported Monday evening that several of the men involved in the operation that killed Moise previously worked as informants for US law enforcement, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, another complication for the US response. Psaki said the US is assessing how the country can directly aid the Cuban people. She said it is too early to predict any potential policy change when it comes to Cuba. So far, that has come in statements encouraging the Cuban regime to listen to the protesters and words of support for the people of Cuba. Biden expressed support for the Cuban people on Monday, calling on Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel's regime to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""Folks, I want to start recognizing remarkable protests taking place in Cuba,"" Biden said when speaking to reporters at the White House. ""I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- quite frankly, ever."" Biden said the Cuban people ""are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime,"" and asserting ""their universal rights."" He also warned the Cuban government against ""attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba."" But earlier this spring, Psaki indicated that Cuba was not among the administration's top policy priorities. ""A Cuba policy shift or additional steps is currently not among the President's top foreign policy priorities. But it is an issue, of course, we will remain engaged in and focused on,"" Psaki told reporters in April. Pressed on whether the weekend events in Cuba have changed the administration's priorities, Psaki said on Monday, ""We will be looking to provide support to the people of Cuba. We certainly, you know, support the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of -- when we believe they deserve to have access to the economic support and medical support, health supplies that many of them are asking for."" In nationally televised remarks Sunday, Diaz-Canel placed blame for the economic conditions on sanctions from the US. Under the Obama administration, Cuba oversaw the reopening of embassies and relaxing of many restrictions long in place since the embargo. But the Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, reinstated travel restrictions and before leaving office, named Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism The Biden administration has yet to take action, but the review of Trump's restrictive Cuba policy is still underway, a senior administration official tells CNN. Several months after taking office, Biden has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor's policies and ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Barack Obama. An administration official confirmed there are no changes on the horizon as the policy is still under review. Cuba's actions haven't exactly encouraged the administration to move quickly to change policy. The country has continued to support oppressive Latin American regimes and crackdown on dissidents. Brain injuries that have appeared to target Americans diplomats abroad have also included many originating in Cuba, leading to the name ""Havana Syndrome."" One major voice of opposition to returning to Obama-era Cuba policies is New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who told CNN he's offered a list of policy recommendations to the White House. Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday why Biden had not yet taken action to lift the Trump policies on Cuba, Menendez said on ""The Lead,"" ""I think the President has had time to review the actual policies under President Obama and all of the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided -- unilateral in terms of concessions -- showed themselves to create absolutely no change inside of Cuba."" ""The regime enriched itself. The Cuban people never saw any benefit from it. So the result of that, I think, is that the Biden administration looked and said, 'Wait a minute -- that didn't seem to work. We have to think about what exactly we should do in this regard,' "" Menendez continued.",['Maegan Vazquez'],7/13/2021 4:02,Biden forced to pivot foreign policy focus to crises in neighboring nations,"['president', 'policy', 'crises', 'pivot', 'nations', 'white', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'foreign', 'neighboring', 'cuba', 'forced', 'focus', 'return', 'administration', 'obama']","But recent incidents in the Caribbean mark a moment in which the Biden administration may be in uncharted territory.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting on reducing gun violence, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Monday, July 12, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden called protests in Cuba ""remarkable"" and a ""clarion call for freedom,"" praising thousands of Cubans who took the streets to protest food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis -- one of the islands biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory. ""The Cuban people are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime. I dont think weve seen anything like this protest in a long long time, if, quite frankly, ever,"" Biden said Monday in a brief exchange with reporters at the start of a meeting with mayors and law enforcement officials to discuss gun violence in the U.S. ADVERTISEMENT The comments marked a notable change in tone from Bidens old boss, Barack Obama, who as president sought to ease decades of tensions between Washington and Havana while loosening U.S. imposed economic sanctions. It was an effort that was reversed by Republican President Donald Trump, who partially rolled back Obamas rapprochement, limiting U.S. travel to the island, banning American financial transactions with dozens of enterprises, and more. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in an earlier statement Monday. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights."" Julie Chung, the acting assistant secretary for the departments Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, on Sunday suggested that the protests were driven by Cuban people exercising ""their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID case/deaths & medicine shortage. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors."" But White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday sought to frame the protests being driven by far broader frustration, calling the demonstrations ""spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban governments economic mismanagement and repression."" Psaki added that the U.S. remains ready to assist Cuba in its COVID-19 vaccination effort, but the Cuban governments decision not to participate in COVAX -- a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to poorer nations -- complicated the effort. ADVERTISEMENT ""We certainly recognize and understand that access to vaccines is one of the issues that a number of individuals on the streets is voicing concern about, but we have to determine what the mechanism would be to work with the Cuban people to get vaccines to them,"" Psaki said. The scene of demonstrators on Havanas Malecon promenade and elsewhere on the island was an unusual scene as the communist leadership has historically shown little tolerance for criticism. Police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted ""Freedom,"" ""Enough"" and ""Unite."" One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., lashed out at Biden for taking a full day to acknowledge the protesters, noting on Twitter that Bidens statement did not describe the Cuba government as "" socialist and communist."" ""The protests in #Cuba began over 24 hours ago And you forgot something,"" Rubio said. Biden said on the campaign trail that he would largely reverse Trumps Cuba policy and return to Obama-era policies. But Biden has largely kept Trumps policies in the place in the early going. Rubio in a letter Monday called on the president to take a series of steps in support of the protesters, including making free satellite internet access available on the island; rallying Western Hemisphere and European Union leaders to condemn the Cuban governments efforts to stifle the voice of protesters; and making ""a clear and unambiguous statement that the current U.S. policies towards the regime implemented by the Trump Administration will remain in place."" Administration officials said their review of Cuba policy is ongoing. ""Were looking carefully and closely at what has just happened, what indeed is happening,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""And as we stated many times, at the heart of the review and at the heart of the policy that would result are democracy and human rights. Thats core to our efforts. That will be reflected in the policy.""","['Aamer Madhani', 'Jonathan Lemire']",7/13/2021 4:15,Biden calls 'remarkable' Cuba protests a 'call for freedom',"['president', 'remarkable', 'policy', 'white', 'biden', 'cuban', 'ap', 'protests', 'cuba', 'freedom', 'calls', 'protesters']","President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting on reducing gun violence, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Monday, July 12, 2021, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Ismael Francisco) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban authorities confirmed Tuesday that one person has died during demonstrations that have shaken the island in recent days by protesting over food shortages, high prices and other grievances against the government. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, 36, died Monday during a clash between protesters and police in the Arroyo Naranjo municipality on the outskirts of Havana. It said an unspecified number of people were arrested and there were some people injured, including some officers. The statement accused demonstrators of vandalizing houses, setting fires and damaging power lines. It also alleged they attacked police and civilians with knives, stones and other objects.. ADVERTISEMENT Demonstrations that erupted Sunday have seen thousands of Cubans in the streets voicing grievances against shortages of goods, rising prices and power cuts, and some protesters have called for a change of government. Havana still had a heavy police presence Tuesday, with officers particularly guarding key points such as the Malecon coastal promenade and the Capitol. Internet and cellphone data service continued to be disrupted. There were no reports of new protests, which the government has sought to blame on Cuban Americans using social media to instigate unrest in Cuba. The demonstrations in several cities and towns were some of the biggest displays of antigovernment sentiment seen in years in tightly controlled Cuba, which is facing a surge of coronavirus cases as it struggles with its worst economic crisis in decades as a consequence of U.S. sanctions imposed by President Donald Trumps administration. The rare outpouring of dissent led former President Raul Castro to join with other top leaders Monday to discuss the situation. ""On July 11, there were riots, there were disorders on a very limited scale, opportunistically taking advantage of the difficult conditions in which we Cubans are living today,"" Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said Tuesday, adding that government experts had found evidence of outsiders using sophisticated equipment to widely broadcast alarmist and inciting messages over social media. But, Rodriguez said, ""On July 11, there was no social explosion in Cuba. There was not because of the will of our people and because of the support of our people for the revolution and its government."" Cubas Roman Catholic bishops issued a call to avoid violence. ADVERTISEMENT ""We understand that the government has responsibilities and has tried to take measures to alleviate the aforementioned difficulties, but we also understand that the people have the right to express their needs, desires and hopes,"" they said in a statement. The demonstrations were extremely unusual on an island where little dissent against the government is tolerated. The last major public demonstration of discontent, over economic hardship, took place nearly 30 years ago in 1994. Last year, there were small demonstrations by artists and other groups, but nothing as big or widespread as what erupted this past weekend. The U.S. has, so far at least, not detected any surge of migrants from Cuba, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. He also cautioned Cubans that any migrants intercepted at sea are returned to their homelands or sent to other countries under long-standing agreements intended to discourage people from trying to make the dangerous crossing. ""The humanitarian message to the people of Cuba is do not take to the seas,"" Mayorkas said. ""People die when they try to migrate in the maritime channel irregularly."" The issue of Cuban migration in opposition to the government resonates with Mayorkas, whose family fled the Cuban revolution in the 1960s. ""I understood what it meant for my father to lose everything that he had built for his young family,"" he said. ""We stand with the people of Cuba.""",['Andrea Rodriguez'],7/13/2021 4:22,Cuba confirms 1 man dead during antigovernment protests,"['prices', 'mayorkas', 'confirms', 'high', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'shortages', 'man', 'antigovernment', 'demonstrations', 'social', 'stand', 'dead']","Police stand guard near the National Capitol building in Havana, Cuba, Monday, July 12, 2021, the day after protests against food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis.

78,https://www.foxnews.com/us/demonstrations-cuba-freedom-communism,"Demonstrations erupted across Florida for the second straight day to show solidarity with anti-government protesters in Cuba and call for an end to the countrys communist regime. From Jacksonville to Tampa and Miami, hundreds of community members took to the streets on Monday to rally for Cuban freedom. CRUZ CALLS OUT BIDEN'S STATE DEPARTMENT AMID REPORTS OF CUBA'S CRACKDOWN ON PROTESTERS ""To me, what it means is a possible end to an oppression,"" Peter Merlo, a demonstrator in Miami, told WSVN-TV. ""We dont need to stand with Cuba. We need to act for Cuba."" Cuban citizens assembled in several cities and towns over the weekend in a rare outpouring of protests over the countrys high prices, food shortages and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Cuban police were out in force on the country's streets as President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Cuban Americans of using social media to fuel the protests. Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon Sunday. In Jacksonville, Fla., demonstrator Eduardo Ramos told local news station WJXT-TV that the Cuban people ""dont have any voice"" under Diaz-Canels regime. ""We dont have access to hospitals, food, medicine, anything,"" Ramos said. ""And people are dying in the street right now."" Demonstrators in Tampa echoed Ramos sentiments. ""The longer we wait the more people will die,"" Daniela Tamayo told WFTS-TV. ""The longer that America waits to intervene the more people will die."" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez joined demonstrators in calling for U.S. intervention in Cuba. ""The Cuban regimes military police are shooting at unarmed Cuban protestors fighting for freedom,"" Suarez tweeted Sunday. ""60 years of communism, cruelty, & oppression cannot last any longer! We are imploring the USA to take action as we peacefully demonstrate on the streets of Miami.""

(Pedro Portal/Miami Herald via AP) MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators expressing solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who waged a rare weekend of protests around their island nation shut down a stretch of a major South Florida expressway Tuesday. The large group gathered at a busy Miami intersection chanting support for the Cubans, who had taken to the streets in the communist nation Sunday to air grievances about poor economic conditions and other complaints. A few miles (kilometers) away, hundreds of supporters gathered for hours Tuesday evening at a park. The peaceful crowd waved flags and cheered on the efforts of island protesters. ADVERTISEMENT Flavia Perez, 16, was brought to the U.S. at age 1. She joined the rally at Tamiami Park, saying, ""Im here to support young Cubans on the island so they have the same opportunities as I have in the U.S."" South Florida is home to the largest U.S. population of Cuban Americans. News helicopter footage from broadcaster WTVJ showed demonstrators earlier Tuesday marching to Miamis Palmetto Expressway, where many blocked traffic in the afternoon. Elsewhere, Floridas Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis held a round table with elected officials, including members of Congress. The gathering at Miamis American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora was closed to reporters, but the governor later asserted that protests in Cuba were more than just about shortages of vaccines, food and other basic items. ""They are revolting against a corrupt communist dictatorship that has ruled that island with an iron fist for over 60 years, that is responsible for death and destruction, not just on the island of Cuba but really throughout the Western Hemisphere,"" DeSantis said at a news conference. He said the demonstrators desire ""a free society."" Nationwide protests last year under the Black Lives Matter movement drew attention to racial injustice in the U.S. after the killings of Black people by police. Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into Florida law a measure that enhances penalties against protestors who turn violent and allows criminal penalties against those who organize protests that turn violent. DeSantis dismissed similarities between Black Lives Matter and Tuesdays demonstrators. ""These are people that are rebelling against a communist dictatorship,"" the governor said. He said the demonstrations in Miami were ""fundamentally different than what we saw last summer."" DeSantis, who is said to be considering a run for the White House in 2024, declined a direct response when asked how Democratic President Joe Bidens administration should handle Cuba policy. But he said federal officials shouldnt be satisfied with small Cuban government accommodations designed to quell demonstrations. ADVERTISEMENT Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, the daughter of Cuban exiles, said the community needs to speak with one voice urging the Biden administration to stand tough against the Cuban government. ""We cannot negotiate with the regime at this hour,"" Salazar said. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami has been monitoring for any ""unsafe and illegal"" crossings between Florida and Cuba in response to rare street protests on the island. Rear Adm. Eric C. Jones issued a warning statement Monday night as groups of Cuban immigrants said they planned to travel in boats filled with supplies to Cuba to show support for the Cuban protesters. In Miami, Cuban social media personalities posted Monday that they would make the 10-hour boat ride to Cuba to show support after rare street protests broke out over the weekend, the Miami Herald reported . The influencers said they would bring aid -- and guns -- and urged people in Miami to offer up their boats. One group gathered Monday night at a marina and people brought cases of bottled water, flashlights and boxes of canned pasta, the newspaper reported. ""Water, food, medicine, whatever we can take to Cuba. Whatever we can take to help is good,"" organizer Dennis Suayero told WSVN . The group didnt get very far Monday night. A message posted on organizer Santiago Riveras Instagram account early Tuesday said the Coast Guard stopped his group from traveling. Over the weekend, thousands of Cuban Americans gathered in Miamis Little Havana in support of Cuban street marches against high prices and food shortages on the island. Such unsanctioned protests are extremely rare, and Cuban police were out in force Monday to control them. The last such demonstrations in Havana took place in 1994. President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Cuban Americans of using social media to egg them on. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez , a Cuban American, tweeted that he has never ""felt such raw emotion from the people of Miami desperate for intervention by the government and by themselves on behalf of Cuba."" Miami wasnt the only Florida city where demonstrators gathered. For a second day, Cuban-Americans in Tampa gathered Tuesday at an intersection, blocking traffic and waving Cuban flags. Like the group in South Florida, Tampa demonstrators attempted to gain access to Interstate 275, but police held them back. Television images showed dozens of protesters in a city that traces its Cuban heritage back generations. Orlando also had hundreds of protestors blocking a busy street for about an hour Tuesday evening.","['Bobcaina Calvan', 'Marta Lavandier']",7/13/2021 12:58,Miami demonstrators block highway to support Cuban protests,"['florida', 'support', 'cuban', 'miami', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'rare', 'gathered', 'highway', 'demonstrators', 'block']","Cuban exiles block the Palmetto Expressway at Coral Way in support of protesters in Cuba Tuesday 13, 2021 in Miami.

81,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/politics/biden-cuba-review/index.html,"Several months after taking office, Biden has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor's policies and ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Barack Obama. The lack of action by the Biden administration on Cuba was highlighted this week after the communist-run island witnessed its largest protests in decades. An administration official confirmed there are no changes on the horizon as the policy is still under review. Biden promised in September 2020, during the campaign, that he would ""try to reverse the failed Trump policies that inflicted harm on Cubans and their families,"" but the review currently underway is unlikely to result in a return to the Obama-era policy of normalized relations with Havana, according to people familiar with the discussions. The thinking is that the Cuban government has shown no signs, in more than five years, of easing its political and economic repression of the Cuban people, which has severely narrowed the Biden administration's options for normalizing ties again -- especially given Biden's emphasis on human rights as a cornerstone of his foreign policy. Biden's team is also wary of the political implications of making concessions to Havana, as Obama did, without getting anything in return. ""Joe Biden is not Barack Obama in policy towards Cuba,"" Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the western hemisphere, told Andres Oppenheimer in April. ""The political moment has changed in an important way, the political space has closed a lot, because the Cuban government has not responded in any way, and in fact the oppression against Cubans is even worse today than perhaps it was during the Bush administration."" Gonzalez added that ""human rights will be a key factor in any conversation that we may have with the regime."" To that end, Biden's team has focused on incremental steps like easing restrictions on remittances that Americans can send to relatives on the island -- which were all but banned under Trump -- and potentially opening up travel again as a way to expose Cubans to American ideals. Other forms of more immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people are also being weighed, as the administration tries to find ways to ""let some of the air out of the pressure cooker"" and defuse the situation before it becomes violent, said one person familiar with the thinking. A second senior administration official said the administration has ""been reviewing our Cuba policy with an eye towards its impact on the political and economic well-being of the Cuban people. Democracy and human rights are central to that assessment."" This official added that ""we are watching the Cuban government's response to the protests very closely, and call on them to refrain from violence and repression against peaceful protesters; and to serve their people rather than enrich themselves."" A congressional aide said discussions have been underway with the administration about opening lines of communication with Cuban protesters and with members of the Cuban military to try to defuse the situation, and to build a coalition of international allies who can send a united message that there will be repercussions if the government reacts violently to the protests. There have also been discussions about how the US can help restore and expand internet access to Cubans, as the regime continues its blackouts, the aide said. ""The Biden administration has been consistent in its calls for the promotion of democracy and human rights in Cuba,"" the second senior administration official said, ""including denouncing abuses by Cuba's authoritarian regime and pushing for reforms. This is not new."" Juan Cruz, who served as NSC senior director for the western hemisphere under Trump, said the US risks getting ""beat over the head by the Cubans"" if it rushes to return to the Obama-era policies amid the protests. There are hopes by some in the administration that this new wave of dissent could create a split within the regime that the US could then capitalize on, Cruz said. But American involvement could backfire and exacerbate tensions even further. ""This is not going to be a 'Cuban spring,'"" he said. ""The administration is not going to go back to the Obama era on this."" Whether Biden will ultimately follow through on his campaign promises remains to be seen. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is a strong opponent of Obama's policies and the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, hinted Monday that he thinks Biden may not. ""I think the President has had a time to review the actual policies under President Obama and all of the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided, unilateral in terms of concessions, showed themselves to create absolutely no change inside of Cuba,"" Menendez told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""So the result of that, I think, is the Biden administration looked and said, 'Wait a minute. That didn't seem to work.'"" On Monday, Menendez and Biden spoke during a brief phone call, according to an official. Biden also told reporters he would talk more publicly about the ongoing crises in Cuba and Haiti later this week. A senior official says he has no formal speech planned but he will likely discuss it more as the US gathers intelligence. How Biden navigates Cuba could carry political implications, given he lost Florida to Trump in the 2020 election after the former President repeatedly claimed Biden would turn the US into a ""socialist country"" if he won, a message that resonated with Cuban Americans. While changing Cuba policy was not among his ""top foreign policy priorities,"" according to top aides, the recent protests have sparked fresh conversations about it inside the West Wing. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets this weekend to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. ""I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- quite frankly, ever,"" Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday. The President said the US ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights,"" and said the Cuban people ""are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime."" He called on the Cuban government to ""refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba."" Biden also told reporters at the White House on Monday that his team was closely monitoring the developments in Haiti in the wake of the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise. He was killed last week on his private residence in the capital of Port-au-Prince, and Haiti's first lady, Martine Moise, was also shot in the attack and evacuated to a hospital in Miami for treatment. Biden on Monday indicated that the US is ""ready to provide assistance"" to both Cuba and Haiti, but it is unclear what form that will take.","['Kaitlan Collins', 'Kate Sullivan', 'Natasha Bertrand']",7/13/2021 12:59,Biden's review of Trump's restrictive Cuba policies still underway,"['underway', 'president', 'policy', 'trumps', 'biden', 'cuban', 'senior', 'policies', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'restrictive', 'bidens', 'political', 'review', 'told', 'administration']","The lack of action by the Biden administration on Cuba was highlighted this week after the communist-run island witnessed its largest protests in decades.

82,https://nypost.com/2021/07/13/bernie-sanders-blames-us-sanctions-for-cuban-protests/,"Outspoken socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez remained silent as of early Tuesday about violent protests erupting in Cuba, while Sen. Bernie Sanders finally spoke out -- to blame US sanctions rather than decades of Communist dictatorship. ""All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society,"" Sanders tweeted just before midnight Monday of the protests that started Sunday demanding ""freedom"" and the removal of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. ""I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence,"" the democratic socialist implored of the leader who had called for ""revolutionaries"" to take to the streets and fight for communism. ""Its also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people,"" Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote. Protests in Cuba began Sunday demanding freedom and the removal of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. AFP via Getty Images His message received backlash from many who suggested he was missing the clear message being sent by protesters demanding freedom from the nations rulers -- with viral images also showing some carrying American flags as a symbol of the democracy they sought. Sen. Bernie Sanders called for an end to the US embargo on Cuba, saying it has ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" AFP via Getty Images ""You want to help? Repost the unedited streams coming from the Cuban youth on the island. They are calling for Liberty and an end to Communism,"" Miami-based musician Eloy Escagedo replied to Sanders. ""As a Cuban, I can tell you the US Embargo have to stay in place until the Castro/DiazCanel dictatorship is out of Cuba,"" someone named May also tweeted him. ""The Cuban people need support to remove the government!!!!!"" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel was seen among protesters calling for changes to the government and his removal. AFP via Getty Images Others noted just how long it had taken the democratic socialist to speak up. ""He needed 72 hours to wrap his head around it,"" economist and conservative blogger Max Murray quipped. Still, Sanders had done more than other progressive Democratic leaders, with critics noting the ongoing silence of the partys usually outspoken progressive ""Squad"" members. Protesters marched through Cuba chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty."" AFP via Getty Images Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was active on Twitter until late Monday -- ripping white supremacy, without any mention of Cuba. Other outspoken ""Squad"" members like Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) also appear to have ignored the protests. Fox Business host Stuart Varney had insisted in his show that the ""silence from Americas left"" was because the protests were highlighting ""the failure of socialism."" ""The far left want to make America more like Cuba. But a lot of Cubans apparently want to be more like Americans,"" Varney said.",['Social Links For Lee Brown'],7/13/2021 13:17,Bernie Sanders blames US sanctions for Cuban protests while AOC silent,"['silent', 'sanctions', 'afp', 'socialist', 'removal', 'president', 'bernie', 'cuban', 'protests', 'sanders', 'aoc', 'cuba', 'democratic', 'getty', 'blames']","Outspoken socialist Rep.

83,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/bloody-monday-cuba-hundreds-likely-missing-police-fire-crowds-protesters/,"A near-nationwide internet blackout severely limited the ability of protesters to share updates and images from Cuba, but the little that has trickled out suggests the island experienced another wave of thousands-strong protests on Monday that has triggered severe communist repression. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets of nearly every major city in the country on Sunday, peacefully assembling to demand an end to communism. Protesters shared videos of crowds marching peacefully on Havanas iconic Malecon and throughout major cities like Camaguey, Cardenas, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba, some of them waving American flags and others sporting Catholic and other Christian imagery in defiance of the officially atheist Communist Party. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead of the Castro regime, responded to the protests by urging ""revolutionaries"" to violently assault unarmed protesters on the streets, describing his call as an ""order of combat."" In response to Diaz-Canels call, both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers have unleashed a wave of repression on protesters that has included shooting at them, attacking them with dogs, and public beatings. The beatings have not been limited to protesters -- among the most gruesome images surfacing on Sunday was that of the bloody face of Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa, beaten publicly by a gang of uniformed police officers for attempting to do his job. The Castro regime appeared to shut down internet access throughout most of the island Monday, limiting the previously extensive flow of citizen journalist videos depicting extreme repression. Reports nonetheless trickled out that appeared to indicate hundreds of people are missing nationwide and families have not been able to see their relatives who have been hospitalized with bullet injuries. Witnesses say police stations have also attracted crowds of loved ones seeking information on the missing to no avail. By early Monday, human rights groups had managed to confirm the arrest or disappearance of 57 people, most of them prominent dissidents with ties to civil society organizations that could document their disappearance. Most observers considered the number significantly lower than the probably true total of arrests and disappearances, citing witness reports of overwhelmed police stations, prisons, and hospitals. On Monday evening, Erika Guevara-Rosas, the Americas director at Amnesty International, shared that the list of confirmed arrests, not counting disappearances, had risen to 115 people in the country. Hasta el momento se reporta la detencion arbitraria de por lo menos 115 personas en el contexto de las protestas, entre ellas, se han detenido ayer y hoy, a periodistas independientes, que valientemente han informando sobre los acontecimientos en #Cuba. Exigimos su liberacion. https://t.co/9rvlLNc989 -- Erika Guevara-Rosas (@ErikaGuevaraR) July 12, 2021 The internet shutdown and police repression have succeeded, in part, in silencing protesters, leading many on the island to reach out anonymously with information on the ground that international establishment media have not bothered to confirm and those outside the island do not have the resources to. In one message circulating in Miami-based media, an unnamed Cuban source describes police stations in major cities as surrounded by crowds of people demanding to know where the missing are. Another report alleged that desperate family members surrounded a police station in Capri, a Havana neighborhood, and attempted to storm it and burn it down; that report remains unverified. Hospitals in the country, already overwhelmed by coronavirus patients, are full of people injured by police, the message continued, but police officials have allegedly cut off access to any patients with bullet injuries or other conditions that indicate they were present at the protests. The few videos that Cubans have managed to smuggle out of the country, and media outlets have been able to verify as authentic and from the protests this week, indicate that the Castro regime has launched a nationwide campaign of violence against anyone calling for its end. In one video shared by the dissident outlet Cubanet -- which lost several reporters to police arrests on Sunday -- a mob of communists carrying baseball bats and large sticks can be seen approaching and assaulting peaceful protesters. Another video published and verified by Cubanet, appearing to be from Santiago de Cuba, shows a protester bleeding out on the street of an apparent gunshot wound in the head. The man appears unconscious and is bleeding profusely from the head as civilians surround him and attempt to wrap his head with cloth to stop the bleeding. ""They killed him, they killed him!"" onlookers shout. Warning: Graphic Video Cubanet reported large protests on Monday in Havana and Holguin, where protesters reportedly surrounded the headquarters of the local chapter of the Communist Party of Cuba. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights published a video Tuesday of unnamed health workers confirming another death at the hands of police. The health workers say a colleague protesting peacefully was ""beaten to death"" in broad daylight; the human rights group does not supply information regarding where on the island the incident reportedly happened. Sanitarios cubanos denuncian la muerte de un companero 'a palos por parte de la policia. Se estan reportando muertes en las protestas, y el responsable de estos crimenes es @DiazCanelB pic.twitter.com/tO5owvQ2dh -- Observatorio Cubano de Derechos Humanos (@observacuba) July 13, 2021 The Cuban independent online newspaper 14 y Medio also reported of a death in Mayabeque denounced by the aunt of the deceased. ""They took his teeth out, they threw the dogs at him, seven, eight black berets [state security officers] beat him,"" the woman said. ""While the children of the henchmen you people defend are in other countries, yours are here and they will pay,"" she added, apparently addressing the police officers allegedly responsible for the killing. 14 y Medio reportedly multiple eyewitness accounts that share a detail with the Mayabeque death: the use of police dogs to terrorize protesters. Cuban journalist Jose Raul Gallego reportedly told the outlet that police executed raids throughout the night of Sunday and early morning Monday, going door-to-door with police dogs and abducting people. Unverified videos surfacing on Facebook appear to show police dragging minors suspected of having participated in peaceful protests out of their homes. In Camaguey, the outlet added, reports suggest as many as 2,000 people injured.

84,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2021/07/13/biden-lifts-sanctions-venezuela-giving-cuba-lifeline/,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury on Monday lifted sanctions on the export of gas to socialist Venezuela, a boon to the dictatorship in Caracas and its patron government in communist Cuba, which struggles to suppress mounting opposition and calls for the regimes total abolition. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued a general license number 40, permitting ""all transactions and activities related to the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, of liquefied petroleum gas to Venezuela"" as well as the socialist regimes state-owned affiliates, specifically rescinding restrictions that then-President Donald Trump imposed via three executive orders in 2018 and 2019. The license remains valid through July 8, 2022. Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the state-owned company managing the nations (and some of the worlds) largest oil reserves, fell under socialist control in 1998, when Hugo Chavez nationalized the entity. With socialist cronies in charge, Venezuelas oil production began to decline at a rapid rate, falling to levels not seen since 1947 by mid-2020. Despite abundant supply, the mismanagement is so great the nation routinely experiences severe gasoline shortages. OFAC left intact sanctions on individual Venezuelan government officials, many of whom allegedly maintain ties with drug cartels, human trafficking organizations, or terrorist cells. Television star Diosdado Cabello, the first vice president of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela PSUV) and Maduros second-in-command, has for years been identified as a major figure in the international drug trade, with informants naming him as the leader of the Cartel de los Soles. The group, run out of the Venezuelan military, operates an international cocaine ring. Formerly the richest nation in Latin America - following the decline of previously richest nation Cuba under communism - due to its vast oil reserves, years of socialist mismanagement have driven the Venezuelan economy into the ground. Inflation in particular has annihilated citizens personal wealth and forced a majority of Venezuelans to eschew the local currency in favor of foreign bills will stable value. A 2020 study revealed that a majority of transactions in Venezuela occurred using the U.S. dollar as a medium. The economy has deteriorated to the extent that citizens have resorted to scavenging food from street trash to avoid starvation. In lieu of stable healthcare infrastructure, Venezuelans have had to improvise means of tending to their sick and injured, with one viral video depicting locals using the back of a garbage truck as an ambulance. The easing of economic restrictions against Caracas will likely provide an economic boost to the socialist dictatorship under Nicolas Maduro, which has maintained power illegally through the military since the expiration of his last legitimate term in 2019. By extension, Cuba -- the regimes de facto colonial overlord -- will secure a much-needed economic windfall amid its struggles to contain both the Chinese coronavirus and a wave of democratic protests. Havana has effectively run Venezuela for years. Maduro defectors and foreign relations experts have reported that the country relies heavily on nearly 100,000 Cuban communist agents to manage the national ""revolution"" since at least 2010. Reports further indicate that Cuba uses its colony as a staging ground for its drug trafficking operations and as a meeting place for its allied terrorist groups like the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization. Caracas has further served as an economic lifeline for Havana, supplying much of the regimes energy needs on credit, with extremely lenient terms. Director of Petroleum for Venezuela Francisco Rodriguez asserted in 2020 that Cuba owed over $11 billion to Venezuela, with a doubtful prospect for repayment. Beginning Sunday, thousands of Cubans took to the streets of at least 20 cities, demanding an end to communism on the island. Originating in San Antonio de los Banos, protesters shouted ""Down with communism!"" and "" fuck Diaz-Canel!"" referencing the nations puppet president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, whom Raul Castro appointed to be the regimes public face. The ""president"" has since called for communists to violently confront the demonstrators and overseen a brutal police crackdown. As of Monday, at least 57 dissidents, including Roman Catholic priests, street artists, and peace activists have been confirmed to be in police custody.",['Ben Whedon'],7/13/2021 15:40,"Joe Biden Lifts Sanctions on Venezuela, Giving Cuba a Lifeline","['sanctions', 'socialist', 'giving', 'venezuelan', 'president', 'nation', 'lifts', 'biden', 'oil', 'foreign', 'cuba', 'venezuela', 'regimes', 'economic', 'lifeline', 'joe']","With socialist cronies in charge, Venezuelas oil production began to decline at a rapid rate, falling to levels not seen since 1947 by mid-2020.

85,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/cuba-90-year-old-raul-castro-resurfaces-to-silence-protests/,"The Communist Party of Cuba trotted out 90-year-old Raul Castro - the nations ultimate leader despite his official retirement - on Monday, claiming he participated in a Politburo meeting on the protests hitting the island on Sunday. Cubans in at least 20 localities around the island organized peaceful manifestations on Sunday believed to have attracted thousands of people. Many marched chanting ""freedom!"" and slogans in opposition to communism. The immediate response from the Communist Party was violence; Cubans have uploaded multiple videos to social media appearing to show police officers opening fire on crowds of protesters, beating them with batons on the streets, and arresting and disappearing participants in the protests. Manifestations continued throughout Monday but the regime shut down access to the internet nearly across the country, preventing Cubans from sharing breaking news from the island outside of encrypted messages and some isolated images. The official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and state television claimed that Castro participated in the meeting alongside President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who Castro hand-picked to be the face of the Party. Cuba experts consider Castro and his extended family the ultimate bosses in Cuba, however, as many hold high-ranking military and Party positions and Raul Castro himself still resurfaces for events the Party deems important enough. Granma did not describe the meeting as an ""emergency"" gathering but gave the impression that it was an urgent attempt to organize a response to the protests. The meeting reportedly occurred on Sunday, but was the lead story on Granma's online homepage on Tuesday morning. ""During the meeting, the provocations orchestrated by counterrevolutionary elements, organized and financed from the United States with destabilizing purposes, were analyzed,"" Granma reported. Granma offered no other information. It published no images that would prove that the nonagenarian dictator was present at the meeting. While its front-page headline promised video content, the video was a news report by communist media featuring only an anchor sitting at a desk and reporting that the meeting had occurred. Prominently advertising Castros involvement in decisionmaking surrounding the protests appears to be a response to the outsized attention the protests have given Diaz-Canel. A longtime Communist Party lackey, Diaz-Canel first became president of the country in 2018. The Cuban constitution states that the president of the country is outranked by the Chairman of the Communist Party of Cuba and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Castro held all three titles before giving Diaz-Canel the presidency, remaining his boss. At the time, Diaz-Canel promised Castro would ""preside over all major decisions for the present and future of the nation."" Castro claimed to have retired in April 2021, giving Diaz-Canel the title of chairman of the Party. His public return indicates, however, that Diaz-Canel still lacks ultimate authority in the country. Protests continued - and, reportedly, intensified - on Monday. The few images surfacing show severely injured unarmed protesters. One video appeared to show an unconscious man bleeding to death on the street while bystanders attempting to wrap the gunshot wound in his head with cloth to save him. Amnesty International has confirmed 115 arrests as of Tuesday, many of them of prominent members of the Cuban dissident community who have been subject to routine arbitrary detentions for decades. Cubalex, an independent human rights group, documented over 150 people either missing or in police custody without being accused of a crime as of Tuesday and continues to update its database in real time. The U.S.-based Marti News reported on Tuesday that the Communist Party had deployed motorized gangs to attack the protests - a staple repressive tactic of Cubas colony, Venezuela. The violence followed a direct order from Diaz-Canel, issued in a televised speech, late on Sunday to ""revolutionaries"" to take the streets and attack peaceful protesters. Diaz-Canel called it an ""order of combat"" against ""counterrevolutionaries"" and explicitly urged violence. On Monday, Diaz-Canel posted another call to violence on Twitter. ""The Cuban Revolution will not turn the other cheek to those who attack it, in both virtual and real-life spaces,"" Diaz-Canel wrote, an apparent rebuke of Christian doctrine. The Communist Party is explicitly atheist and has regularly persecuted Christians of all denominations since 1959. The Castro regime actively persecuted Christians in the 1960s by placing them in the Military Units to Aid Production (UMAP), labor camps for ""undesirables"" and ""counterrevolutionaries."" Several of those arrested and beaten on Sunday and Monday are members of Christian clergy. ""Let us avoid revolutionary violence but we will repress counterrevolutionary violence,"" Diaz-Canels statement on Twitter continued. ""Whoever attacks the agents of order attacks the country."" Despite the call to ""repression,"" Diaz-Canels tweet remains available on that platform at press time. La #RevolucionCubana no va a poner la otra mejilla a quienes la atacan en espacios virtuales y reales. Evitaremos la violencia revolucionaria, pero reprimiremos la violencia contrarrevolucionaria. Quien ataca a los agentes del orden ataca al pais #SomosCuba pic.twitter.com/7lLPk30wcV -- Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez (@DiazCanelB) July 12, 2021 Granma reported on Monday that, following the Politburo meeting and call to violence, Diaz-Canel held a Party meeting on Monday to discuss several unrelated topics, apparently ignoring the protests. Among them was the failing Cuban power grid and its fully collapsed socialist healthcare system.

86,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/americas/cuba-protests-100-detained-missing-intl/index.html,"Havana, Cuba and Madrid, Spain (CNN) Anti-government activists in Cuba say that more than 100 people have been arrested or are missing on the island following widespread protests on Sunday. One person died during clashes with police on Monday, Cuba's Ministry of Interior said Tuesday, according to state-run Radio Rebelde. The Movimiento San Isidro, which advocates for greater artistic expression in Cuba, published a list of activists that it said were believed to have been detained by authorities. Among the detainees is journalist Camila Acosta, according to Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares, who called for her release. The Interior Ministry said the man who died and other protesters had attacked officials. On Sunday, CNN journalists witnessed multiple people being forcibly arrested and thrown in the back of vans at protests in Havana. Videos of the protest showed demonstrators turning over a police car and throwing rocks at officers. The Cuban government has not said how many people were arrested or injured in the disturbances. A police car is overturned during a demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on July 11. These are the largest protests on the island in decades, as Cubans complained about a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. In San Antonio de los Banos, a city of about 46,000 people to the west of Havana, hundreds of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday, fed up after nearly a week of electricity cuts during the sweltering July heat. ""Everyone was in the streets,"" one resident, who did not want to be named, told CNN. ""They have gone six days with only 12 hours of power each day. That was one of the things that blew this up."" On Wednesday night, the Cuban government announced it would lift restrictions on travelers bringing in food, medicine and hygiene products. Custom duties on these products will not need to be paid, and the relaxed measures will stay in place for the rest of the year. Diaz-Canel had previously blamed US trade sanctions for the communist-run island's economic woes in a nationally televised address, and urged his supporters to physically confront the protesters. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance on Sunday. ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets."" He denied police had used excessive force -- but days later, acknowledged the government needed to do more outreach and improve conditions in poor neighborhoods that had been rocked by the protests. He said he didn't know the exact figure, but estimated ""tens of people"" had been injured in the protests. President Miguel Diaz-Canel (in dark blue shirt, wearing a mask) walks with supporters Sunday after an anti-government protest in San Antonio de los Banos, Cuba. The government also held a meeting on Sunday to discuss the protests, according to state media. It was attended by high-ranking members including former President and Communist Party head Raul Castro, the brother of former President Fidel Castro. Castro retired his last leadership role in April before turning over power to his handpicked successor Diaz-Canel. At the time, Diaz-Canel said Castro would be consulted on all major issues impacting the island. Journalist detained Acosta, the detained journalist, writes for the ABC newspaper in Madrid, the Spanish capital. ABC reported that she was arrested on Monday morning in Havana as she left her home. Later, Cuban security agents searched her home and took her computer, it said. Hours earlier, she had reported on anti-government demonstrations in the Cuban capital on Sunday. This is not the first time that Acosta has had a run-in with Cuban authorities for doing her job as a reporter, ABC said. The newspaper said that her arrest is ""completely unacceptable."" It also called for Acosta's ""immediate release and the return of all professional material taken from her home,"" as well as the dropping of the charges against her for alleged crimes against Cuban state security. An editor at ABC confirmed to CNN that Acosta is a Cuban national and had been working at the paper for around six months. Cubans gather outside the Capitol to demonstrate against the government of President Miguel Diaz-Canel on July 11. Spain's Foreign Minister Albares called for her immediate release in a tweet, saying that, ""Spain defends the right to free and peaceful demonstrations and asks the Cuban authorities to respect that. We defend human rights."" US President Joe Biden has warned the Cuban government not to crack down on its newly defiant citizens. But on Monday, at another lengthy televised government meeting, Diaz-Canel said the protesters were criminals. ""They stoned the police force, damaged cars,"" he said. ""A behavior that's completely vulgar, completely indecent."" Cuban government officials on Monday said there had been no more protests as they enacted an internet blackout. This prevented Cubans from sharing images of demonstrations that had gathered momentum behind the protests in the first place. Meanwhile, US-Cuban relations are at their lowest point in years. The Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, and so far, the Biden administration seems reluctant to lift them. Biden's review of Trump's policy is still underway, an administration official confirmed. Several months after taking office, he has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Obama. Whether Biden will ultimately follow through remains to be seen. Sen. Menendez, a strong opponent of Obama's policies and the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, hinted Monday that he thinks Biden might not, after reviewing ""all the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided, unilateral in terms of concessions."" US State Department spokesman Ned Price on Tuesday called on the Cuban government to show restraint and stop its internet blackout. In Miami, the center of the Cuban exile community in the United States, protesters have taken to the streets in support of the anti-government demonstrators. On Tuesday, parts of the Palmetto Expressway was shut down by protesters, according to Lt. Alex Camacho of the Florida Highway Patrol. The US Coast Guard has issued a statement urging Cubans on the island ""to not take to the sea,"" noting the ""dangerous and unforgiving"" transit across the Florida Straits has claimed nearly 20 lives in recent weeks, according to Rear Adm. Eric Jones, commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District in Miami. The already struggling Cuban economy has been hit hard as tourism and good imports have dropped steeply during the pandemic. On Sunday, Cuban health officials also reported a record single-day increase for new Covid-19 cases and deaths. On Monday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador joined Cuban officials in calling for the US to suspend the Cuba trade embargo as a humanitarian gesture. ""No country in the world should be fenced in, blockaded -- that's the opposite of human rights,"" he said. When asked why Biden had not yet reversed Trump's policies towards Cuba, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday the US had continued to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies, but added, ""I have nothing to preview for you in terms of a change of policy."" And US Secretary of State Tony Blinken has pushed back against criticism from the Cuban government, saying ""it would be a grievous mistake for the Cuban regime to interpret what is happening in dozens of towns and cities across the island as the result or product of anything the United States has done."" ""That is what we are hearing and seeing in Cuba, and that is a reflection of the Cuban people, not of the United States or any other outside actor,"" Blinken said.

87,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/13/cuba-protests-activists-journalists-protesters-detained,"One person has died during demonstrations in Cuba over food shortages, high prices and other grievances against the government. The interior ministry said on Tuesday that Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, 36, died during a clash on Monday between protesters and police in the Arroyo Naranjo municipality on the outskirts of Havana. It said an unspecified number of people were arrested and there were some people injured, including some officers. The statement accused demonstrators of vandalising houses, setting fires and damaging power lines. It also alleged they attacked police and civilians with knives, stones and other objects. The confirmation follows reports that scores of activists, protesters and journalists, including a reporter for one of Spains leading newspapers, have been detained as Communist party security forces seek to smother Sundays historic flare-up of dissent. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty Internationals Americas director, said at least 140 Cubans were believed to have been detained or had disappeared in the aftermath of Cubas largest demonstrations in decades. ""The idea is to punish those who dare to challenge the government ... and send a message"" that no further protests would be tolerated, said Guevara-Rosas, who said spontaneous and peaceful rallies had taken place in at least 48 separate locations, including Havana. On Tuesday Spains foreign minister, Jose Manuel Albares, demanded the immediate release of Camila Acosta, a Cuban journalist who reports for a Spanish newspaper and was among those seized from their homes in the capital early on Monday. ""Spain defends the right to demonstrate freely and peacefully and asks the Cuban authorities to respect it. We unconditionally defend human rights,"" Albares said on Twitter amid reports that Acosta, who reports for the conservative ABC paper, would be charged with crimes against state security. Earlier this month the group Reporters Without Borders named the Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, as one of the ""press freedom predators"" of 2021, alongside Nicaraguas authoritarian leader, Daniel Ortega, and Brazils far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and called Cuba ""Latin Americas worst media freedom violator"". On Monday Diaz-Canel painted the protests - which erupted as Cuba faces a severe economic crunch exacerbated by US sanctions and a Covid pandemic that has shattered the islands tourist industry - as part of a foreign plot to ""fracture"" the communist revolution launched by Fidel Castro in 1959. A special forces vehicle patrols downtown Havana on Monday. Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters Carolina Barrero, a Havana-based activist, said the wave of detentions were intended ""to erase"" Sundays demonstrations and ensure there was no repeat. ""[This] is a dictatorship - this is what they do,"" Barrero said from her home in Havana, where she has been under house arrest since June. Guevara-Rosas said internet shutdowns meant it was hard to verify the precise scale of the crackdown on demonstrators, who had been protesting against shortages of food and medicine as well as one-party rule. But targets appeared to include prominent human rights campaigners, independent journalists and one of the leaders of the Movimiento San Isidro, a collective of artists and activists that has been pushing for greater political freedoms. Marta Maria Ramirez, 46, a feminist and LGBT activist, said she knew dozens of people who had been arrested, among them Gretel Medina, a young film director who is breastfeeding her baby son. ""Im very sad about the violent response from authorities,"" Ramirez said. ""Police are repressive everywhere. But thats not whats proclaimed here - in Cuba they are supposed to be an organ of the people, they are supposed to protect the people."" On Monday, Joe Biden called on Cuban authorities to respect citizens rights, ""including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future"". In a televised broadcast Cubas foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, hit back, attacking the ""extraordinary cynicism and hypocrisy"" of US politicians. Rodriguez urged the US president to stop the ""brutal repression"" that US police forces inflict on African Americans and journalists. Rodriguez also slammed Bolsonaro after he accused Cuba of ""massacring"" its peoples freedoms. ""Brazils president should sort out his performance which has contributed to the deplorable death of hundreds of thousands of Brazilians from Covid ... and worry about the acts of corruption he is involved in rather than seeking to distract attention by casting a superficial eye on Cuba,"" Rodriguez tweeted. Albares, who was appointed foreign minister in Spains Socialist-led coalition government over the weekend, stopped short of condemning recent events in Cuba. In a statement released on Tuesday morning, his ministry urged Cuban authorities to ""speed up the pace of reform"" to help the island address the economic crisis and the lack of tourist revenues due to the Covid pandemic. Cuban exiles in Miami announced seemingly half-baked plans to make the 10-hour boat journey from Florida to Cuba on Monday to offer the protesters supplies, support and perhaps even guns. The US coast guard indicated it was unlikely to allow flotillas to undertake the ""dangerous and unforgiving"" journey across the Florida straits and was monitoring attempts to make ""unsafe and illegal"" crossings.","['Tom Phillips', 'Ed Augustin']",7/13/2021 16:56,Cuba protests: one man killed and more than 100 missing in historic unrest,"['reports', 'president', 'including', 'missing', 'rodríguez', 'rights', 'spains', 'cuban', 'unrest', 'protests', 'foreign', 'cuba', 'man', '100', 'killed', 'historic', 'authorities']","One person has died during demonstrations in Cuba over food shortages, high prices and other grievances against the government.

88,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/13/palmetto-expressway-shut-down-because-of-protesters/,"MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A small group of protesters asking President Joe Biden and Gov. Ron DeSantis to help protect Cuban protesters marched to block traffic on the Palmetto Expressway on a rainy Tuesday in Miami-Dade County. One of their chants in Spanish: ""Estados Unidos, acaba el comunismo!"" Its a rhymed request for the Biden administration to put an end to communism. Demonstrators confront police as they try to get onto the Palmetto Expressway, Tuesday, July 13, 2021, in Miami. Demonstrators are protesting in solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who waged a rare weekend of protests around their island nation against the communist regime. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) (Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.) They lined up for hours under the rain on the southbound and northbound lanes of the expressway. Officers and Florida Highway Patrol troopers blocked access from Coral Way to Flagler Street. Some of the protesters who have relatives on the island said they fear the Cuban governments violent crackdown on dissent. Cubans report having internet connectivity problems and power outages since the Sunday protest. Related story: Drivers on Okeechobee Road show solidarity with SOS Cuba protesters disrupting traffic Ad Miami-Dade Police Department officers and Florida Highway Patrol troopers asked drivers to avoid the expressway and use the Florida Turnpike instead. They were also negotiating with the protesters, reminding them that blocking roads is illegal in Florida. Some of the protesters held umbrellas, and white, red, and blue Cuban and U.S. flags. Some used signs and T-shirts to display the ""Patria Y Vida,"" or ""Homeland and Life,"" motto of the protests across Cuba Sunday. The phrase is meant to antagonize the late Fidel Castros rallying cry of ""Socialism or Death"" and the late Che Guevaras ""Homeland or Death"" speech at the United Nations in the 1960s. The expressways southbound lanes reopened briefly at first and shut down again. Officers kept a group of protesters away from the expressway near a gas station where customers were trapped in. Ad Another group of protesters crossed through the yellow crime scene tape blocking access to the ramp and joined the demonstration. A family cheers while on the Palmetto Expressway, Tuesday, July 13, 2021, in Miami. The demonstrators, many of them Cuban exiles, expressed support for Cubans, who had taken to the streets of several communities around the communist nation on Sunday to air grievances over poor economic conditions, among other complaints. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) (Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.) For some, it was a family activity with parents and grandparents. Some took toddlers to the protest. There were groups of teenagers. Some played music and used pots and pans to make noise. They were working to make sure the US and allies hear Cubans cries for help. Many are in communication with relatives and friends who are learning about the victims of aggressive police tactics in Havana and other cities. Activists reported violent raids and arbitrary arrests continued Tuesday. The rare act of desperation made headlines worldwide, but Cuban Americans in South Florida want to make sure people dont just forget. There were demonstrations in Miami-Dade County Sunday night, Monday and there were plans to continue through the week.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Tuesday that those fleeing Cuba or Haiti by sea would not be allowed into the U.S. -- and would either be returned or, if they were found to have a fear of persecution, referred to a third country.

Camila Acosta, who was reporting on the civil unrest in Cuba, was detained Monday as police in the Communist country rounded up at least 100 people since thousands of protesters took to the streets of Havana and elsewhere. ""Spain defends the right to demonstrate freely and peacefully and asks the Cuban authorities to respect it,"" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said in Spanish on Twitter. ""We demand the immediate release of Camila Acosta,"" Albares wrote.

The newspaper reported Tuesday that Acosta is being charged in Cuba with ""crimes against state security,"" and urged the Spanish government to pressure Cuba. Cuban government officials cracked down in the wake of Sundays unrest, the largest anti-government demonstration on the Communist-ruled island in decades. Camila Acosta is being charged in Cuba with ""crimes against state security,"" according to a Spanish newspaper. Camila Acosta/Twitter Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel blamed the demonstrations, which were sparked by food shortages and financial hardships on the island, on the US. Diaz-Canel said ""the Cuban-American mafia"" and ""influencers and YouTubers"" were behind the mass unrest.

92,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/univision-cuba-not-priority-joe-biden/,"A Univision report Monday on President Joe Bidens tepid response to the ongoing protests against communism in Cuba accused Biden of having little interest in the topic, noting his administration ""openly admitted"" to not prioritizing the island. Univisions report focused on the outpouring of support from Cuban-Americans and others within the United States for the protests in the country, which began on Sunday and attracted thousands of people to every major city on the island. Journalists managed to document protests in at least 20 municipalities nationwide stretching from far-west Pinar del Rio to Santiago de Cuba, the eastern capital of Oriente province. The marches, the largest wave of a movement against communism that has organized weekly protests for nearly two decades, featured protesters walking peacefully chanting slogans against the 62-year-old communist regime. ""Freedom!"" was a common chant nationwide, as well insults against Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead ""president"" of the Castro regime. Some protesters also waved American flags or wore clothes emblazoned with the symbol of freedom. Diaz-Canel responded to the protests by urging ""revolutionaries"" to take the streets and violently assault unarmed protesters in a speech on Sunday. Cuban authorities blocked access to the internet nearly nationwide, preventing the deluge of violent imagery that surfaced on Sunday from repeating on Monday. As of Tuesday, however, Cubans are slowly starting to find ways to share footage of the island, revealing egregious human rights abuses on the part of the Communist Party like public beatings and police shooting dissidents dead in broad daylight. Univision initially spoke to a group of Cuban-American protesters in Washington, D.C., who said they sought ""urgent military interventions"" to save their loved ones. The report noted that such support is unlikely, though Biden issued a statement nominally extending support to the Cuban people. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" Bidens statement read in part. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime."" The statement notably omitted the fact that Cubas regime is communist, that the protesters actively chanted slogans against communism and socialism, and reframed the protests as being about ""economic suffering."" Bidens only concrete move on Cuba on Monday was the lifting of sanctions on Venezuelas oil industry. Venezuela is a colony state of Cubas, largely run by Cuban state security agents, and the Communist regime has largely subsisted on Venezuelan oil in the aftermath of the rise of socialist dictator Hugo Chavez. ""Despite the support that President Biden is offering to the people of Cuba today, this White House has openly admitted that the issue of the island is not a priority for this government,"" Univision White House correspondent noted in the report, as documented by the Media Research Center: DEVASTATING close to today's @UniNoticias reporting on #SOSCubaLibre by @janrodrigueztv: ""...this WH has openly admitted that the (Cuban) issue is not a priority for this Administration"". pic.twitter.com/4NZMJ1WC7G -- Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) July 12, 2021 Rodriguez added in a note on her Twitter account a quote from White House press secretary Jen Psaki stating, ""I cant saw at what priority level Cuba is in."" Elsewhere in Mondays press conference, Psaki made the bizarre claim that Cubans chanting the word ""freedom"" were actually demanding ""freedom from COVID"" [Chinese coronavirus]. Rodriguez noted Psaki had previously dismissed Cuba as not a priority at all. ""A Cuba policy shift is not currently among President Bidens top priorities,"" Psaki told reporters in March. As a presidential candidate last year, Biden attacked President Donald Trump on multiple occasions for his anti-communist policies, particularly increased sanctions on human rights violators on the island and support for the Cuban exile community at home. Trump also restored Cuba to the State Departments State Sponsors of Terrorism list in response to Havanas support of Marxist terrorist groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Islamist groups like Hezbollah. Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama, who all but eliminated the Cuban embargo, leading to record levels of repression of peaceful dissidents. ""The administrations approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago,"" Biden said in October 2020. Biden promised to help ""empower the Cuban people to determine their own future,"" without elaborating. In practice, Biden has taken no significant action on Cuba, meaning the Trump policies largely remain in place. A significant number of political observers note the scale of the protests erupting this week is much larger than the usual protests and the regime appears unable to quell them, suggesting Cuba may be closer to freedom as a result of Trumps policies than it was before the policies were implemented. Protests reportedly continued on the island on Tuesday. Most of the information currently leaving the country is from its largest cities -- Havana and Santiago -- but limited communication between Cubans on the island and those in the United States suggests that Camaguey, Mayabeque, Holguin, and other central areas also remain nodes of unrest.",['Frances Martel'],7/13/2021 19:11,Univision: Cuba 'Not a Priority' for Joe Biden,"['president', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'univision', 'protests', 'priority', 'cuba', 'regime', 'island', 'freedom', 'joe', 'protesters']","A Univision report Monday on President Joe Bidens tepid response to the ongoing protests against communism in Cuba accused Biden of having little interest in the topic, noting his administration ""openly admitted"" to not prioritizing the island.

""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" Bidens statement read in part. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago,"" Biden said in October 2020. In practice, Biden has taken no significant action on Cuba, meaning the Trump policies largely remain in place.",www.breitbart.com,Right,5620,"[ 2.15543993e-03  3.38186473e-02 -1.27370665e-02  1.94857437e-02

WASHINGTON -- The State Department on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering an array of options to help the Cuban people, after thousands of protestors filled the streets in the island nation this week over frustrations with a crippled economy hit by food and power shortages. ""We are always considering options available to us that would allow us to support the Cuban people, to support their humanitarian needs, which are indeed profound. And they are profound because of not anything the United States has done, but from the actions and inactions, mismanagement, corruption of the Cuban regime,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. Price said that in 2020 the U.S. exported more than $175 million worth of goods to Cuba, including food and medicine. He also condemned the Cuban government's forceful attempts to silence peaceful protesters and called on Havana to ""release anyone detained for peaceful protest."" Sunday's rare protests, the largest the communist country has seen since the 1990s, come as the government struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic, pushing the island's fragile health-care system to the brink.",['Amanda Macias'],7/13/2021 19:44,"U.S. considering ways to help Cuban people after protests, State Department says","['profound', 'peaceful', 'state', 'food', 'considering', 'support', 'help', 'department', 'ways', 'protests', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'options']","Cuban Americans demonstrate outside the White House in support of demonstrations taking place in Cuba on July 12, 2021 in Washington, DC.

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday told any migrants fleeing unrest in Cuba: ""Let me be clear: If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States."" But Cuban migrants are largely flocking to the U.S.-Mexico land border, not the U.S. coast. And in a sharp break from his predecessor Donald Trump, President Joe Biden has been letting most in pending the outcome of their asylum applications, according to government data. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Since Biden took office in late January, the number of Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has risen sharply. This fiscal year through May, which began in October, border officials encountered more than 22,000 Cubans, the highest level in more than a decade. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows vividly the sharp contrast between the approaches of the Trump and Biden administration toward Cuban migrants. In December 2020 - the last full month of Trump's presidency - nearly two-thirds of all Cubans caught crossing the border were expelled to Mexico under a pandemic-related health order known as Title 42. By May of this year, the last month data is available, around 96% of Cubans were allowed into the United States to reunite with U.S.-based family members and seek legal status in immigration court. The majority of Cuban migrants being allowed in are single adults, a notable development because Biden has continued to expel the vast majority of individual adults arriving from Central America and Mexico. He has made exceptions only for unaccompanied minors and most families. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. UNREST ON THE ISLAND In Cuba, thousands have joined recent protests in cities across the nation amid frustrations with widespread shortages of basic goods including medicine, power outages, rising prices and a surge in COVID-19 cases. Some demonstrators also called for political change. The Cuban government has blamed the shortages on U.S. sanctions and says the United States has backed the opposition. read more It is not yet clear whether the unrest could lead to even more people trying to flee the island. Mayorkas said in his press briefing that the United States has not seen an uptick in migration via sea. ""Any migrant intercepted at sea, regardless of their nationality, will not be permitted to enter the United States,"" Mayorkas said. ""This risk is not worth taking."" He said 20 people have died in recent weeks during these voyages.  The U.S. Coast Guard recently sent two cutter boats to back up others in nearby waters off the coast of Haiti, which is also experiencing a political crisis following the assassination of its president. ""Our priority is to preserve and save lives,"" Mayorkas said. U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio voiced concerns this week an explosion in anti-government protests in Cuba could spark a return to the era of massive boatlifts of Cubans seeking refuge at U.S. shores. Rubio, a Cuban-American representing Florida, raised the specter of the iconic Mariel boatlift in the 1980s and a 1994 surge in rafts leaving the island, saying on Twitter that the Cuban government could use the protests as an excuse to lift travel restrictions and spark another crisis at sea. Pedro Ruiz, 51, who said he had to flee Cuba in 2016 because of his involvement in an opposition political party, encountered the stark difference between Trump and Biden policies on his journey to the United States. Ruiz first escaped to Brazil, then discovered he could try for U.S. asylum and headed to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2019. But when he tried to cross, border agents sent him back to Mexico under a different Trump-era policy, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, that forced migrants to wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings. Ruiz was stuck in a shelter in the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez for two years until Biden reversed the policy soon after he took office this year. Ruiz was finally allowed across the border in March to start a new life with his family in Miami while pursuing his asylum case. ""The only thing that Biden did was restore internationally protected asylum laws that Trump had violated,"" said Ruiz in a phone interview. ""That was the only change.""

96,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2021/07/13/cuba-shuts-down-internet-silence-citizens-hide-ongoing-protests/,"Cubas state-run telecom monopoly ETECSA restricted access to major social media platforms and messaging apps on Monday as part of temporary internet shutdowns meant to quell anti-government protests across the island, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Tuesday. ""On Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram,"" Alp Toker, the director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm, told the AP on July 13. ""This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,"" he said. While the microblogging website Twitter ""did not appear to be blocked,"" as of July 12, Toker ""noted Cuba could cut it off if it wants to."" ""On Sunday [July 11], all of Cuba went offline for less than 30 minutes, after which there were several hours of intermittent but large [internet] outages,"" Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis for Kentik, a network management company, told the AP on July 13. Confirmed: Social media and messaging platforms restricted in #Cuba from Monday on state-run internet provider ETECSA; real-time network data corroborate reports of internet disruptions amid widening anti-government protests; incident ongoing #CubaSOS https://t.co/7eGwPS1Mqf pic.twitter.com/kY3G1qMAse -- NetBlocks (@netblocks) July 12, 2021 NetBlocks reviewed Cuban network data and ""confirm[ed] partial disruption to social media and messaging platforms in Cuba from 12 July 2021."" ""The targeted restrictions are likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba following widespread protests on Sunday [July 11] as thousands rallied against the socialist government,"" the London-based internet monitor wrote in a blog post. ""The restrictions are ongoing as of Tuesday the 13th midmorning local time."" ""NetBlocks metrics show that communications platforms WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and as well as some Telegram servers are disrupted,"" according to the internet watchdog. Cubans only have access to government-owned telecommunications services, all of which are affected. Cubas most recent internet blockages began on the same day Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel told reporters he blamed an alleged social media ""campaign"" for instigating the countrys anti-government protests starting Sunday. ""As if pandemic outbreaks had not existed all over the world, the Cuban-American mafia, paying very well on social networks to influencers and YouTubers, has created a whole campaign ... and has called for demonstrations across the country,"" President Diaz-Canel said during a nationally televised appearance on July 12 ""in which his entire Cabinet was present,"" according to the AP. ""Mafia"" is a common Communist Party term for the Cuban-American exile community, comprised almost entirely of victims of the violent Partys 62-year rule. ""Weve seen how the campaign against Cuba was growing on social media in the past few weeks,"" he added. ""Thats the way its done: Try to create inconformity, dissatisfaction by manipulating emotions and feelings."" Cubas state-mandated internet shutdown has severely limited the amount of information protesters have been able to share about ongoing anti-government demonstrations over the past 24 hours. Mass protests began in Cuba on Sunday, attracting thousands of Cubans simultaneously across dozens of cities to ""demand an end to communism,"" Breitbart News reported on Tuesday.",['Gabrielle Reyes'],7/13/2021 20:38,"Cuba Shuts Down Internet to Silence Citizens, Hide Ongoing Protests","['shuts', 'media', 'told', '12', 'internet', 'protests', 'ap', 'cuba', 'social', 'citizens', 'platforms', 'antigovernment', 'ongoing', 'silence', 'hide']","Cubas state-run telecom monopoly ETECSA restricted access to major social media platforms and messaging apps on Monday as part of temporary internet shutdowns meant to quell anti-government protests across the island, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Tuesday.

97,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/beijing-lends-fellow-communists-hand-china-stands-ready-work-cuba/,"The Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed on Tuesday that the United States was single-handedly responsible for all woes that Cuban people suffer under communism and asserted Beijing ""stands ready to work with Cuba,"" presumably to suppress the nationwide protests that began this weekend. Cuba is a member of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an infrastructure debt trap program run by the Communist Party of China, and is one of Beijings oldest allies. Both countries are members of the United Nations Human Rights Council and energetically defend themselves in that venue against the overwhelming evidence of human rights atrocities committed by their respective regimes. Protests erupted in at least 20 municipalities throughout Cuba on Sunday calling for an end to the 62-year communist rule people have endured there. While Cuban dissident organizations have invested decades in organizing civil society to demand respect for their basic civil rights, plans to challenge the regime accelerated this year as groups organized conventions to plan a transition out of communism and focused attempting on recruiting pop stars and other artists to the cause. Chronic food shortages and a collapsed healthcare system, hallmarks of all communists regimes, exacerbated the need for protests during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, the official responsible for the discredited conspiracy theory that the Chinese coronavirus originated in a U.S. Army laboratory, issued the first comment from the Chinese government on the ongoing protests in Cuba on Tuesday. ""China firmly opposes foreign interference in Cubas internal affairs, firmly supports what Cuba has done in fighting COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], improving peoples livelihood and upholding social stability,"" Zhao said, ""and firmly supports Cuba in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions."" Cuba has a notoriously poor track record in handling the coronavirus pandemic that includes inviting tourists from hotspots like Italy to visit the island at the height of the pandemic and refusing to shut down schools. ""Id like to stress that China stands ready to work with Cuba to implement the important consensus of the two heads of state and is firmly committed to deepening friendly relations between the two countries,"" Zhao added. He did not specify in what way China would be ""ready to work"" with Cuba, leaving open the possibility that Beijing would support Cubas repression of dissidents in the context of the protests this week. Cuban human rights groups believe hundreds of peaceful protesters are either in police custody illegally or have disappeared. Death tolls have not surfaced so far but dissidents have shared videos on social media showing police opening fire into crowds of unarmed protesters, leaving some on the ground, bloodied and appearing to suffer from gunshot wounds. Other images out of Cuba show police flagrantly beating unarmed protesters in broad daylight. Zhao also took the opportunity to condemn the government of the United States, which has played no role in the protests. ""As the Cuban side pointed out, the US embargo is the root cause of Cubas shortage of medicines and energy,"" Zhao falsely claimed. ""The US should fully lift its embargo on Cuba and play a positive role in helping the Cuban people overcome the effects of the epidemic."" The U.S. ""embargo"" does not prevent shipments of medicine or humanitarian supplies to Cuba. It has also done little to prevent tourism to the island, and it does not prevent Cuba from trading with over 190 countries around the world. The true embargo banning humanitarian aid from directly reaching Cubans in necessary quantities is a policy implemented by the Castro regime once American supplies arrive in Communist Party custody, where much of it disappears into the bureaucracy instead of the hands of its intended recipients. China extended its support to Cuba on the anniversary of the 1994 massacre of 41 civilians on the March 13 tugboat, at the time attempting to flee the country by sea to the United States. Cuban officials flooded the vessel, carrying 72 people, using hoses in international waters. Several of the victims were toddlers; the youngest was a six-month-old girl. China became Cubas largest trade partner in 2017 and began investing heavily in Cuban infrastructure after Miguel Diaz-Canel, appointed the face of the Castro regime in 2018, visited Beijing that year and signed onto the Belt and Road Initiative. ""As socialist countries, China and Cuba are good friends, comrades, and brothers,"" Chinese dictator Xi Jinping said during his meeting with Diaz-Canel at the time. ""Chinese people will never forget that Cuba, led by Comrade Fidel Castro, was the first nation in the western hemisphere to forge diplomatic ties with China 58 years ago."" A year later, Cuba debuted a Chinese-built railway connecting Havana and Santiago de Cuba, the countrys two largest cities on opposite ends of the island. No evidence suggests Cuban citizens received jobs or benefits from the infrastructure project in any way, as Cuba bought the rail cars pre-made from China with a 15-year Chinese loan. Like most BRI agreements, the provisions of the deal remain a secret.

Many described it as a potential turning point in a country where the Communist Party has managed to stifle even small challenges to its authority for decades. ""The spark has been lit, ladies and gentlemen, theres no turning back,"" the independent journalist Yoani Sanchez said in a brief podcast she recorded on Tuesday. ""People felt what its like to scream freedom in the streets of Cuba."" The Cuban government often detains dissidents for a day or two after security forces break up demonstrations. It was unclear whether Sundays detentions would lead to a new generation of long term political prisoners. Daniel Triana, a Cuban actor who was held at a Havana detention center for about 24 hours, described a flood of protesters being led into the cell where he was kept. ""A lot of people throughout the country are still detained, I would say hundreds,"" he said in a phone interview. ""In my wing, there were dozens of people and they were bringing in people when I got there, and they were bringing in people when I left."" Camila Remon, a member of Movimiento San Isidro, said the recent protests were enabled by widespread internet connectivity on the Island, a relatively new phenomenon.","['Ernesto Londoño', 'Frances Robles']",7/13/2021 22:08,'The Spark Has Been Lit': Cuban Dissidents Feel Emboldened Despite Crackdown,"['streets', 'despite', 'wing', 'lit', 'yoani', 'feel', 'cuban', 'bringing', 'turning', 'day', 'spark', 'crackdown', 'country', 'emboldened', 'dissidents', 'described']","Many described it as a potential turning point in a country where the Communist Party has managed to stifle even small challenges to its authority for decades.

99,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/13/man-dies-in-anti-government-protest-in-cuba-interior-ministry,"Rare demonstrations spurred by a deepening economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic rock Cuba in recent days. A man died during an anti-government protest on Monday on the outskirts of Havana, the Cuban interior ministry said on Tuesday, as rare demonstrations spurred by economic inequalities have rocked the island. Protesters took to the streets of the Cuban capital as well as other cities across the country on Sunday to denounce the government of President Miguel Diaz-Canel amid food shortages and a deep economic crisis worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. The rallies have been met with a wave of arrests and allegations of police brutality, as authorities cracked down on demonstrators. The interior ministry said on Tuesday that it ""mourns the death"" of a 36-year-old man named as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, who the state news agency said had taken part in the ""disturbances"". The Cuban News Agency said ""organised groups of antisocial and criminal elements"" had tried to reach the suburb of La Guineras police station, with the aim of attacking its officials and damaging the infrastructure. Several citizens and security officials were injured in the protest, the report also said. It did not say how the man died. This is the first confirmed death linked to the protests, which are the largest in Cuba in decades. Waldo Herrera, a 49-year-old resident of La Guinera, told the Reuters news agency that protesters were ""marching peacefully, shouting slogans like 'Down with communism, 'freedom for the people of Cuba, 'we dont have medicine, we need food.'"" Herrera said the protesters started throwing stones at security forces, who eventually responded with gunfire. Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, calling on defenders of the Cuban revolution to take to the streets on Sunday to counter the anti-government demonstrators. The Cuban president also said US sanctions on the country are fuelling misery. Amnesty International said it had received with alarm reports of ""internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force - including police firing on demonstrators"". At least 100 protesters, activists, and independent journalists had been detained nationwide since Sunday, according to exiled rights group Cubalex. Some were detained at the protests but others as they tried to leave their homes, the organisation said. The Cuban government did not immediately comment on the arrests. Cuba also has seen a recent surge in coronavirus infections, as doctors and nurses urge people to get jabs to stem the spread of the virus. The country has reported more than 250,500 cases and more than 1,600 deaths to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data. On Tuesday, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks said the Cuban government has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp. NetBlocks, based in London, said on its website that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegraph in Cuba were partially disrupted on Monday and Tuesday. ""The pattern of restrictions observed in Cuba indicate an ongoing crackdown on messaging platforms used to organize and share news of protests in real-time,"" said the groups director, Alp Toker. ""At the same time, some connectivity is preserved to maintain a semblance of normality."" People shout slogans against the government during a protest in Havana on July 11 [Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] Havana-based journalist Reed Lindsay told Al Jazeera that mobile phone data remained down for most residents on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Cubas foreign minister has blamed the US of waging a ""fake news campaign"" to stoke the unrest amid a deluge of misinformation on social media, he said. ""Its very difficult to pin down what is going,"" he said. ""There are a lot of rumors floating around."" As the uncertainty in Cuba continues, US Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday said migrants considering making a journey to the US irregularly by sea will not be allowed into the country. ""Any migrant intercepted at sea, regardless of their nationality, will not be permitted to enter the United States,"" Mayorkas said in a news briefing. ""This risk is not worth taking."" It is not yet clear whether the unrest could lead to even more people trying to flee the island, which is just across the Florida Straits from the US. Mayorkas said 20 people have died in recent weeks during these voyages. ""Our priority is to preserve and save lives,"" he said.",[],7/13/2021 22:18,Man dies in anti-government protest in Cuba: Interior ministry,"['dies', 'security', 'interior', 'mayorkas', 'protest', 'cuban', 'unrest', 'recent', 'protests', 'cuba', 'man', 'antigovernment', 'ministry', 'protesters']","Rare demonstrations spurred by a deepening economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic rock Cuba in recent days.

A protest broke out in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday in support of the anti-government protesters in Cuba and participants appealed to the Biden administration to take a firmer stance on the crackdown in Havana. ""Where is Biden?"" the protesters chanted, according to Fox 13 News. ""Where is Biden?"" Protests have broken out across the state and this particular rally resulted in three arrests after the protesters blocked traffic on Dale Mabry Highway and forced the partial closure of Interstate 275. The demonstrators yelled, ""Cuba Libre!"" 'A SPARK HAS BEEN LIT The report said two men face charges of battery on an officer and resisting arrest, another faces charges of resisting arrest. The Biden administration has said it stands by the people of Cuba who demand basic human rights. President Biden called the protests ""remarkable"" and a ""clarion call for freedom."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted that the U.S. ""stands with the Cuban people seeking freedom and respect for their human rights."" He called the violence against peaceful protestors ""abhorrent."" The White House did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the administration is considering how it could be ""helpful directly to the people of Cuba."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said the Biden administration can impose new sanctions, open up satellite Internet access on the island and ""issue a clear and unambiguous statement that the current U.S. policies towards the regime implemented by the Trump administration will remain in place,"" according to the Washington Post. The Cuban government has blamed those U.S. policies for the economic hardship faced in the country. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana on Sunday to lash out at the worsening conditions in the country under the communist regime - the biggest protest in decades - prompting the countrys president to call on ""revolutionary"" citizens to counter the protesters. The Miami Herald reported that some Democrats in South Florida want Biden to deliver a clear message of support to the protesters in Cuba from Miami and compared the moment to Ronald Reagan's 'Tear Down this wall speech. ""I really believe this is one of those moments, I put it up with the moment of 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall because I do believe we can give the hope to the people in Cuba,"" state Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Democrat, told the Herald. ""Its really about the people in Cuba who need to hear it. The words of the president of the U.S., be it Republican or Democrat, should matter.""

Neither the rain nor the Florida Highway Patrol troopers nearby dissuaded him from joining the demonstration. He said they were disrupting traffic to help deliver the message that Cuban protesters on the communist island risked their lives for Sunday. ""We need this regime to be gone. People are dying. Kids are out in the street protesting. They are getting beaten by the Cuban regime,"" Hernandez said. The drivers on Okeechobee Road did not appear to be annoyed, as protesters stopped the eastbound lanes traffic flow intermittently. Most of the drivers were displaying Cuban and U.S. flags and were honking in solidarity. ""Most of them as you can see are truck drivers. They basically support us,"" Hernandez said. ""Most of them have work to do ... but they are still stopping ... We havent had any issues at all."" Ad Other Cuban Americans participating in demonstrations in Miami-Dade have said the rare uprising is a sign of the desperation that Cubans are facing. There have been food and medicine shortages. The government hasnt been able to take hold of the coronavirus pandemics public health and economic crises. ""This is them demonstrating about how they feel about their nation,"" said FHP Lt. Carlos Venegas said. Hernandez said the traffic disruptions are a way of raising awareness and helping Cubans on the island to deliver their message. The Cuban government has disrupted internet connectivity. There have been power outages. Officers have raided homes. Videos on social media show shootings, beatings, and violent arrests. Some Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade County havent been able to get in touch with relatives in Havana and other cities. Hernandez and others in Miami-Dade said its the duty of those who are living in freedom to help those who are not. Ad ""We need the message to the president: We dont want diplomatic relations. We dont want negotiations with the regime,"" Hernandez said. ""We want closure ... We want the United States to do more."" There were similar demonstrations in Miamis Little Havana, at Tamiami Park near Westchester, and on the Palmetto Expressway at Coral Way.

Thirteen-year-old Lola Rodriguez was there with her grandparents. Lola has never been to Cuba, but she has heard the stories about her grandparents having to abandon their homes as children. Lola has also learned about the pain the late Fidel Castro has caused to Cubans on the communist island and to Cuban American families in Miami-Dade County. She said the demonstrations give her hope. ""I feel proud to be Cuban,"" Lola said, adding she has ""faith"" that she will be able to visit a ""free Cuba"" one day. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has also participated in the demonstrations and has asked President Joe Biden to listen to the pleas for help. The desperation prompted the rare uprising in Havana and other cities Sunday. Videos on social media show Cuban police officers beating, arresting, and shooting at protesters. The videos also show mobs chanting for ""Freedom"" despite the one-party systems aggressive repression of dissent. Ad After the protests, Cuban relatives told Miami-Dade residents there were internet connectivity issues and power outages. Activists said these are efforts to silence protesters pleas. Gov. Ron DeSantis said companies in Florida should be able to help with internet connectivity. In Miamis Little Havana, police officers kept the traffic flowing in both directions. Many of them were Cuban Americans themselves and said they felt like a part of the movement to support Cuban protesters who are paying a heavy price. Danet Collada, a Miami-Dade resident, said she felt anguish, as she waited for updates from her family in Cuba. ""There is no communication whatsoever. We dont know whats going on,"" Collada said. We are just hoping and praying that the strong valiant Cuban heart has kept them alive.""

105,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/7/14/cuba-restricts-access-to-social-media-apps-to-curb-protests,"Mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests and activists say government is restricting access to messaging apps. Cuba has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks has said, in the wake of the biggest anti-government protests in decades. Thousands of Cubans joined demonstrations throughout the Communist-run country on Sunday to protest against a deep economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. NetBlocks, based in London, said on its website on Tuesday that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram in Cuba were partially disrupted on Monday and Tuesday. ""The pattern of restrictions observed in Cuba indicate an ongoing crackdown on messaging platforms used to organise and share news of protests in real-time,"" said NetBlocks director Alp Toker. ""At the same time, some connectivity is preserved to maintain a semblance of normality."" Cubas government has said the demonstrations were orchestrated by counterrevolutionaries financed by the United States, manipulating frustration with an economic crisis largely caused by the decades-old US trade embargo. The protests, rare in a country where public dissent is tightly controlled, had largely ended by Sunday evening, as security forces were deployed to the streets and President Miguel Diaz-Canel called on government supporters to go out and fight to defend their revolution. But another protest flared late on Monday in the southern Havana suburb of La Guinera, where one man died and several others, including members of the security forces, were hospitalised with injuries, according to state-run media on Tuesday. It did not say what caused the death. No other deaths and injuries have been officially confirmed so far. Hundreds had taken to streets in La Guinera, shouting slogans such as ""Down with communism"" and ""Freedom for the people of Cuba"" according to two residents and video footage seen by the Reuters news agency. Some started throwing rocks at security forces who eventually responded with gunfire, said resident Waldo Herrera, 49. ""I think the Communists have lost control, they wont have a solution to this situation,"" he said. ""The people are tired of so much humiliation, so much repression."" A Reuters witness saw dozens of people carrying sticks departing La Guinera late on Monday. Activists say the government is using so-called rapid-reaction brigades - government-organised bands of civilian recruits - to counter protesters. Mobile internet disrupted They also accuse the government of trying to disrupt communications. Introduced just over two years ago, mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests, giving Cubans more of a platform to express their frustrations and enabling the word to get out quickly when people are on the street. In the capital, there have been regular and atypical mobile internet outages since Sunday, according to Reuters witnesses. Facebook Inc, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said that it was concerned about its services being restricted in Cuba, in a statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. ""We oppose shutdowns, throttling, and other disruptions of the internet that limit the debate of our community. We hope connectivity will be restored as soon as possible so that Cubans can communicate with family and friends,"" said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman. Asked whether the government was intentionally restricting internet connections, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told a news briefing the situation was ""complicated."" He said power outages could affect telecommunications services and ""Cuba would never renounce the right to defend itself"". Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter Inc said it found no blocking of its service. ""Our weapon is the internet. If they take away the internet we are unarmed,"" said Havana resident Gino Ocumares, as he tried but failed to connect to the internet at a government WiFi hotspot. ""The government does not want people to see the truth."" 'Provocations The protest in La Guinera was spearheaded by ""antisocial and criminal elements"" that had tried to reach the police station with the aim of attacking its officials and damaging infrastructure, said the state-run Cuban News Agency. Cuba says 'antisocial and criminal elements are behind the protests [File: Yamil Lage/AFP] When security forces stopped them, they vandalised homes, set containers on fire, and damaged the suburbs electrical wiring, attacking officials with stones and other objects, the agency said. State-run media also reported on Tuesday that Raul Castro, who stepped down as head of the ruling Cuban Communist Party in April, attended a meeting on Sunday of the political bureau to address the ""provocations"". Diaz-Canel said in April he would continue to consult Castro on matters of utmost importance. The Cuban Bishops Conference said in a statement it was worried that the response to protests over legitimate concerns would be ""immobilism"" rather than an attempt to resolve them, and even a counterproductive hardening of positions. Reaction to the protest in Latin America split along ideological lines, with Mexicos president blaming the US embargo for fomenting the unrest, while Chile and Peru urged the government to allow pro-democracy protests. US President Joe Biden said on Monday that the United States ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights"". State Department spokesman Ned Price called on the Havana government to open all means of communication, online and offline. ""Shutting down technology, shutting down information pathways - that does nothing to address the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Cuban people,"" Price told a news briefing on Tuesday.",[],7/14/2021 4:46,Cuba restricts access to social media apps to curb protests,"['security', 'media', 'access', 'protest', 'apps', 'guinera', 'whatsapp', 'cuban', 'internet', 'protests', 'la', 'cuba', 'curb', 'social', 'restricts', 'forces']","Mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests and activists say government is restricting access to messaging apps.

An activist there said soldiers raided a home and beat up a protester so badly his family thinks he is dead. Leticia Ramos Herreria is an established voice of dissent in the area. She said there have been violent raids and beatings. Officers have been rushing into homes to make arrests. She is waiting for her turn. ""At any moment they will come to knock my door down and take me ... They are going to disappear me and they are also going to end my family,"" she said in Spanish Tuesday adding officials heavy-handed response is targeting the opposition in Cardenas. The outspoken member of the Damas De Blanco doesnt scare easily. She leads a chapter of the organization, which a teacher founded in Havana to engage in persistent peaceful protests after her husband became a political prisoner. For years, she has been the victim of judicial harassment. Authorities have beaten her, arrested her, and denied her medical treatment while in detention. Ad Ramos Herreria said members of a special forces unit known as the Black Wasps invaded the home of her daughters longtime friend in Cardenas. She said the armed black-clad men hunted the young womans husband who had been involved in the protests. ""The husband was beaten to the ground ... There is a huge pool of blood in the room,"" Ramos Herreria said adding the victims relatives believe he is dead and the couple has children ages 2 and 12. She said ""murderers"" are attacking unarmed Cubans. The violence comes amid shortages of food and medicine and a lack of access to healthcare for COVID patients who are dying at home. She said they are out of fuel, gas, and now electricity. The crackdown also included disrupting internet connectivity. ""We are in a chaotic situation,"" Ramos Herreria said adding there is a desperate need for humanitarian intervention. She also said it is important for the international community and ""all people of goodwill"" to be aware of the ongoing human rights violations in Cardenas. And with the courage that has turned her into an internationally well-known human rights advocate, she said the new campaign of terror wont silence her.

108,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-communist-cuba-protests,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has a long history of praising Cuba's regime, which is currently cracking down on protesters demanding freedom after decades of communist rule. Sanders faced scrutiny for initially remaining silent on the protests that erupted across Cuba over the weekend, before issuing a statement late Monday night. His statement urged the government to refrain from violence, but also criticized the U.S. for its trade embargo on the island country. LIVE UPDATES: CUBA CRACKS DOWN ON PROTESTERS; CONCERNS GROW OVER REPORTS OF MISSING DETAINEES The protests could put Sanders in an awkward spot, given his consistent praise for the communist regime. Sanders defended his past praise for deceased Cuban dictator Fidel Castro in an interview he gave last year as he was leading the Democratic presidential primary. ""We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but, you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad,"" Sanders said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview. ""You know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?"" Video footage unearthed last year showed Sanders recalling his excitement for the communist revolution during a speech in the 1980s. ""I remember, for some reason or another, being very excited when [former Cuban dictator] Fidel Castro made the revolution in Cuba,"" he said, while speaking at the University of Vermont in 1986. ""I was a kid ... and it just seemed right and appropriate that poor people were rising up against rather ugly rich people."" During that speech, Sanders said he almost had to ""puke"" when he saw former President John F. Kennedy push his opponent at the time, former President Richard Nixon, to be tougher on Cuba. ""For the first time in my adult life, what I was seeing is the Democrats and Republicans ... clearly that there really wasn't a whole lot of difference between the two,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanders' other comments have included praising bread lines and Soviet public transportation; defending Castro as someone in Cuba who ""educated their kids, gave their kids health care, totally transformed the society""; and mocking criticism of the Marxist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. Sanders' office didn't return an email from Fox News inquiring whether he regrets any of his past comments about Cuba.

Marco Rubio, R-Fl., issued a dire warning to President Biden Wednesday morning: take a stand against the Cuban government or there will be a ""bloodbath"" in the island nation's streets. In a video posted to Twitter, Rubio called on the president to lead the international community to pressure the Cuban government to stop retaliating against protesters. 'WHERE IS BIDEN?' CHANT BREAKS OUT AT FLORIDA PROTEST IN SUPPORT OF CUBA ""Ive asked them to use diplomacy - that they brag about, convene the United Nations, convene the Organization of American States in emergency session, discuss these abuses, pressure or shame the international community into condemning and isolating that regime and pressure them to be prepared to take action to prevent a massacre, a bloodbath,"" Rubio said. ""Not halfway around the world, not in the Middle East, not in another continent, right here 90 miles from our shores."" ""A horrific bloodbath is what awaits if action is not taken and something like that does not happen,"" the senator added. Rubio described how the Cuban government has cracked down on protesters by shutting off people's electricity, internet, and cell phone services, while giving children weapons and telling them to attack people who are protesting. CRUZ CALLS OUT BIDEN'S STATE DEPARTMENT AMID REPORTS OF CUBA'S CRACKDOWN ON PROTESTERS The Florida Republican said this should be a bipartisan issue and that he would like to work with the Biden administration on this, but that so far the White House's response has been ""weak."" Rubio claimed that the reason for this is that the person in charge of Cuba policy at the State Department ""has a long history of supporting engagement, of getting closer to the regime in Cuba,"" including planning trips for members of Congress to meet members of the Cuban government. ""Were not going to have a strong response from Biden as long as someone like thats in charge of Cuba policy,"" Rubio said. ""That needs to change."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News reached out to the State Department and the White House for comment but neither immediately responded. Sen.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., praised the communist country's policies. ""To talk about health care in Cuba is to talk about one of the saddest things on Earth,"" Miami physician Dr. Grazie Christie told ""Fox & Friends."" Christie said, ""there is no health care in Cuba for the regular people."" She explained further that there are clinics for foreign visitors and tourists and there is one special hospital for the communist elite. The hospitals and clinics for everyone else are ""covered in roaches and rats and have no equipment."" BERNIE SANDERS DEFENDS FIDEL CASTRO'S SOCIALIST CUBA: 'UNFAIR TO SIMPLY SAY EVERYTHING IS BAD' ""They have no medicine. They have no gauze. When a Cuban person in Cuba needs to have an operation, they call their family members here in Miami to send them gauze, syringes, suture material, and thats what they use in Cuba for operations,"" Christie said. ""The Cuban people have nothing for themselves."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has a long history of praising Cuba's regime, which is currently cracking down on protesters demanding freedom after decades of communist rule. Sanders faced scrutiny for initially remaining silent on the protests that erupted across Cuba over the weekend, before issuing a statement late Monday night. His statement urged the government to refrain from violence, but also criticized the U.S. for its trade embargo on the island country. Sanders defended his past praise for deceased Cuban dictator Fidel Castro in an interview he gave last year as he was leading the Democratic presidential primary. Video footage unearthed last year showed Sanders recalling his excitement for the communist revolution during a speech in the 1980s. Sanders' office didn't return an email from Fox News inquiring whether he regrets any of his past comments about Cuba. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Christie said that left-wing officials' failure to condemn communism is ""a terrible blindspot"" and ""could be malicious because they do not like the way Cuban-Americans vote."" She encouraged public officials to go online to read Cubas State Department website to learn about the conditions of Cubas health care system. Christie described Cuba as a ""terrible, corrupt nation where the people suffer indescribable poverty"" that is ""imposed from above. ""Because there is plenty of money in Cuba pouring in all sorts of ways, the Cuban government is very wealthy but they keep that money. That money goes to their own bank accounts and the people suffer tremendously,"" she said. ""Any assistance that we get, any time that we interact with the Cuban government, the Cuban government makes itself stronger, increases its hold and gets richer.""

Senator John Kennedy told Fox News' Harris Faulkner on ""The Faulkner Focus"" that Biden needs to be actively working with world leaders to support the Cuban people. 'WHERE IS BIDEN? CHANT BREAKS OUT AT FLORIDA PROTEST IN SUPPORT OF CUBAA SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: What's happening in Cuba is - it's a contradiction for me. It's both beautiful, but it also disgusts me to my core. It's beautiful because what we're seeing is people's innate thirst for freedom. Our desire for freedom is deeply seeded. It's almost part of the human condition. And the Cuban people want their freedom. When Castro took over, he promised them freedom. Instead, he gave them socialism, which we now know, of course, is just trickle-down poverty. So that part is beautiful. And I think we ought to do everything we can to support the people, the good people of Cuba. What I find disgusting is the fact that all President Biden has done is issue a press release. That's it. I don't even know if he read the thing. President Biden needs to be on the telephone. He needs to be calling the leaders of the UK, of Canada, of New Zealand, of Australia, of India, of Japan, of South Korea, of the European Union, and saying let's issue a joint statement supporting the people of Cuba. Let's talk about additional sanctions on the Castro government. We've got the Castro government down now, the people have. Let's choke him to death.

112,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/cuban-americans-flood-cities-nationwide-calling-for-end-to-communism/,"NORTH BERGEN, New Jersey - Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Cuban-Americans have convened for peaceful assemblies nationwide this week in solidarity with their kin on the island, who have flooded the streets of nearly every major Cuban city since Sunday demanding an end to the communist regime. Cuban-Americans and their allies in New Jersey, New York, Kentucky, Illinois, California, Ohio, and Washington, DC, have organized ""free Cuba"" rallies meant to encourage Cubans on the island to continue peacefully demanding an end to communism and to urge the government of the United States - particularly the administration of President Joe Biden - to act to protect Cuban lives. Naturally, however, Florida - home to the nations largest Cuban-American population, hosted the largest and most recurring assemblies against communism on the island. Protesters there shut down the Palmetto Expressway, the largest highway connecting the city, on Tuesday, and have maintained a consistent presence at the historic Cuban restaurant Versalles urging an American military intervention in the situation. In contrast to the overwhelmingly destructive riots in support of left-wing causes last summer, the Cuban freedom movement has organized peaceful protests nationwide, with minimal reports of police activity and no significant property damage. In response to the protests, the face of the Castro regime, Miguel Diaz-Canel, issued an ""order of combat"" urging communist vigilantes to violently attack anyone peacefully protesting in their neighborhoods, essentially calling for civil war. The Cuban government shut down internet access nearly nationwide, making it difficult to track police activity, but dissident groups fear hundreds are missing and dozens dead after police began opening fire on crowds of protesters and detaining people in door-to-door raids. On Tuesday night, hundreds of Cuban-Americans and allies marched on Bergenline Avenue in North Bergen, Guttenberg, and West New York, New Jersey - a historic commercial district largely rebuilt by Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 1970s following its collapse in the post-World War II era. While Hudson County, where these small municipalities are located, has been solidly Democrat strongholds for over a century, Democrat politicians in the area are traditionally vocally anti-communist. The mayors of several local cities attended the rally and pressured Washington to intervene in the violence in Cuba. New Jersey Cubans, afraid for their loved ones, desperate for change in their home country, take over Bergenline Ave in Hudson County. @MarciRubinN12 is there. @News12NJ pic.twitter.com/EeCNbsOwRB -- Nick Meidanis (@NickMeidanis) July 13, 2021 ""We need to see military action,"" Mayor Brian Stack of Union City, who also serves as a state senator, told NJ.com. ""I believe the United States shouldve been there years ago. Just like weve liberated other countries, we should liberate Cuba, make that country free for the Cuban people. Stop all the politics all around."" Across the Hudson River, Cubans spontaneously organized a rally in Times Square, Manhattan, on Sunday in the immediate aftermath of breaking news of nationwide protests. Protesters continued to inhabit Times Square on Tuesday and are Cuba libre en Times Square, somos millones unidos por la libertad plena de todos los cubanos !!!!! #yaempezoelfin #patriayvida #SOSCuba Posted by Tomas Castellanos Nunez on Sunday, July 11, 2021 Cubans also made their presence known in the nations capital, standing outside the White House carrying anti-communist images and posters with slogans calling for freedom. In another growing Cuban-American enclave - Louisville, Kentucky - hundreds of people organized a protest Tuesday urging American action to help prevent casualties on the island. ""Tuesdays organizers tell us this was the largest event theyve seen in Louisville,"" local broadcasters WHAS 11 reported, ""beating out nearly 900 people who showed up to Shively Park this past weekend."" Cincinnatis Fountain Square, about an hour and a half from Louisville, held its own pro-Cuba protest on Tuesday. Local outlets reported that about 80 people attended the rally, significant as Cincinnati does not boast a notably large Cuban-American population and is only about an hour and a half from Louisville, making that a likelier host city for such an event. Chicagoans took the streets on Monday for the same cause. ""People have to say 'enough is enough,"" Alberto Gonzalez, the owner of 90 Miles Cuban Cafe in the city, told local news station WGN. ""I lived in Cuba and know what its like not to eat for a few days. I left in 1980. I can only imagine today how bad it is."" One of Los Angeles oldest Cuban establishments, Portos cafe, hosted a rally on Sunday in solidarity with the cause, as well. Portos Downey /Show solidarity with the Cuban people now Posted by Fernando B. Marquet on Sunday, July 11, 2021 Floridas protests were the nations largest, spanning throughout the panhandle. Hundreds organized a rally in Al Lopez Park, Tampa, on Tuesday, chanting pro-freedom slogans and calling for change. Multiple groups attended the rallies, causing a minor traffic disruption, despite the poor weather. #ICYMI For the 3rd straight night, Cuban Americans protested in Tampa for freedom in #Cuba. Tampa PD eventually called it an unlawful assembly and ordered them to disperse. 3 people were arrested during the protests. #SOSCubaLibre #SOSCuba #CubaSOS #CubaNoEstaSola #patriayvida pic.twitter.com/sOoqrkqnbY -- Bobby Bills (@BobbyBillsTV) July 14, 2021 Miami has essentially experienced non-stop protests attracting likely thousands of people since Sunday. Protesters stormed the Palmetto Expressway on Tuesday and shut it down. The sidewalk outside of Versailles - a restaurant known for its little window (ventanita) where older Cubans congregate to drink coffee and shout about politics - has hosted hundreds of people since Sunday. Another historic Cuban-American location, Tamiami Park, also held multiple rallies this week. The Tamiami Park event on Tuesday also commemorated the 27-year anniversary of the March 13 tugboat massacre, in which the Cuban communist regime drowned 37 people in international waters attempting to flee the country. The group was unarmed and included several toddlers. The youngest victim was a six-month-old girl. ""Were commemorating one massacre now, and were trying to prevent another one,"" Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, the head of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, told WPLG Local 10.

113,https://nypost.com/2021/07/14/airstrikes-against-cuban-regime-should-be-considered-miami-mayor-suarez-says/,"The mayor of Miami, Florida, has called on the US to consider military action to overthrow the Communist regime in Cuba -- even if that means launching airstrikes. Francis Suarez -- whose father was Miamis first Cuban-born mayor -- told Fox News on Tuesday that ""what should be being contemplated right now is a coalition of potential military action in Cuba."" He highlighted previous US military action in Panama, Kosovo and Pakistan, the latter of which ""probably saved thousands"" of lives by killing Osama bin Laden when President Biden was vice president. ""Are you suggesting airstrikes in Cuba?"" Fox News host Martha MacCallum asked. ""What Im suggesting is that that option is one that has to be explored and cannot be just simply discarded as an option that is not on the table,"" Suarez insisted. Cubans take part in a demonstration in support of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canels government in Arroyo Naranjo, Havana. AFP via Getty Images ""Thats something that needs to be discussed and needs to looked as a potential option in addition to a variety of other options that can be discussed."" He later told the Miami Herald that he was expecting a call from the president -- and planned to ask him to consider military intervention. ""Its difficult for any elected official, Republican or Democrat, not to take the side of the Cuban people when they see images of people risking their lives, protesting in the streets,"" he said of the mass demonstrations. Suarez also stressed that ""the Cuban people are not asking for the lifting of an embargo"" enforced by the US. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images He also stressed that ""the Cuban people are not asking for the lifting of an embargo"" enforced by the US, which Cuban officials and many on the left have blamed for the protests. ""Theyre not yelling out, 'End the embargo. Theyre not yelling out, 'We need food. Theyre yelling out, 'We want liberty, we want freedom,'"" he told MacCallum. ""Theyre going out on the streets every single day talking about the failure of the Communist regime to provide for its people. And it has failed for six decades,"" he said. Since protests broke out in Cuba over the weekend, thousands have also taken to the streets of Florida, home to the largest US population of Cuban Americans -- closing down a number of major roads on Tuesday. State troopers stand guard as people block Palmetto Expressway during a protest showing support for Cubans demonstrating against their government, in Miami. AFP via Getty Images As hundreds of others also rallied at a Miami park, a large group shouted support for the Cuban protesters as they blocked traffic on Miamis Palmetto Expressway in the afternoon. For a second day, Cuban Americans in Tampa gathered Tuesday at an intersection, blocking traffic and waving Cuban flags. Like the group in South Florida, Tampa demonstrators attempted to gain access to Interstate 275, but police held them back. Orlando also had hundreds of protesters blocking a busy street for about an hour Tuesday.

114,https://nypost.com/2021/07/14/us-will-turn-away-cubans-and-haitians-fleeing-by-boat-dhs-chief/,"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday vowed to turn away Cuban and Haitian refugees who attempt to arrive in the US by boat amid crises in their countries. ""Allow me to be clear: If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" Mayorkas said at a news conference. Cuba on Sunday had its largest protests in decades, with citizens denouncing the Communist leadership and a lack of food and COVID-19 vaccines. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated last week, sparking a political crisis. The DHS secretary said the Coast Guard is monitoring the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico and that ""any migrant intercepted at sea, regardless of their nationality, will not be permitted to enter the United States."" Instead, sea migrants will either be returned to their home country or sent to a third country if they make a credible claim of ""fear of persecution or torture."" Alejandro Mayorkas is aiming to discourage migration by sea as the Biden administration grapples with a crisis along the US-Mexico border. AFP via Getty Images Mayorkas, whose family fled Cuba in 1960 when he was a baby, said that so far there hasnt been a surge in boat refugees from the countries. Only 470 Cubans and 313 Haitians have been intercepted aboard boats and rafts in fiscal 2021. There were 49 Cubans and 430 Haitians intercepted in fiscal 2020. Cuban American voters in Florida helped former President Donald Trump easily carry the state last year after he claimed repeatedly that Democratic policies could turn the US into a socialist country like the one they left. Mayorkas spoke to discourage migration by sea as the Biden administration grapples with a crisis along the US-Mexico border driven by families and children from Central America. Mayorkas said that so far there hasnt been a surge in boat refugees from Cuba and Haiti. picture alliance via Getty Image The number of US-Mexico border detentions hit a 21-year monthly high of more than 180,000 in May. Nearly 179,000 people were detained in April and more than 173,000 were intercepted in March. Republicans argue that President Bidens policies are to blame for that crisis -- a stance also taken by Guatemalas president as well as Mexicos president. Biden backs bills to legalize most illegal immigrants, canceled construction of Trumps US-Mexico border wall and ended the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy that required Central Americans to remain in Mexico while US courts reviewed claims of persecution.",['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],7/14/2021 15:55,Cubans and Haitians fleeing by boat warned against traveling to US,"['sea', 'traveling', 'president', 'mayorkas', 'fleeing', 'usmexico', 'refugees', 'cubans', 'intercepted', 'country', 'haitians', 'crisis', 'boat', 'border', 'warned']","AFP via Getty ImagesMayorkas, whose family fled Cuba in 1960 when he was a baby, said that so far there hasnt been a surge in boat refugees from the countries.

115,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/14/desantis-team-pushes-back-establishment-media-salivates-peaceful-cuba-protests-these-are-not-riots/,"Gov. Ron DeSantiss (R-FL) office is pushing back after members of the establishment media, particularly in Florida, accused the governor of hypocrisy by asserting he is not using his anti-riot law to halt peaceful demonstrations in the state. The Miami Heralds editorial board published a piece Tuesday with a glaring headline loaded with suspicion: ""DeSantis anti-riot law didnt apply as Cuba protesters shut down a Miami-Dade road. Hmmm..."" ""Floridas misbegotten anti-riot law leaves even peaceful demonstrators subject to being arrested if a protest is arbitrarily deemed a 'riot. The law explicitly makes blocking a highway a felony offense,"" the board wrote. ""Worse, it gives civil legal immunity to people who drive through protesters who are blocking a road -- basically, encouraging haters to do just that,"" it asserted. The editorial boards bitter diatribe followed peaceful demonstrations in the state as people stood in solidarity with thousands of Cubans who took to their own streets to protest the oppressive, communist regime. One of the Florida demonstrations saw protesters blocking State Road 826 on Tuesday, prompting DeSantis critics to sound the alarm. But, as DeSantiss office pointed out, protesters were compliant with local law enforcement, and that is exactly what the anti-riot law does -- empowers local law enforcement. Demonstrators were not attacking police officers, charging vehicles, or defacing property, all of which served as hallmarks of the violent Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests that devastated communities across the country last year. Even ABC News recognized the crowd of demonstrators as ""peaceful."" However, the Miami Heralds editorial board overlooked those factors and offered a suggested quote for the governor: ""Nah, the Miami-Dade demonstrators seeking human rights in Cuba have nothing to fear from my anti-riot law. We created it to subdue Black folks seeking human rights in the United States."" It wasnt a riot. But whatever racist wrote this anti-Cuban American propaganda should be fired. https://t.co/FCRlB3rwHp -- Cernovich (@Cernovich) July 14, 2021 #BREAKING - The Palmetto Expressway (SR-826) has been shut down in both directions near Coral Way and SW 32nd Street as protestors voicing their support for the people of Cuba went onto the expressway. pic.twitter.com/8cCFNmL5m7 -- WSVN 7 News (@wsvn) July 13, 2021 DeSantis signed Floridas anti-riot bill in April, which effectively takes defunding the police ""off the table"" in Sunshine State. It also strengthens penalties for those who engage in lawless behavior during a riot. Authorities did not deem the peaceful protests seen in Florida as riots, and, notably, blocking highways was already an illegal act prior to the anti-riot law. Further, the law explicitly defines a riot as a ""'violent public disturbance involving an assembly of three or more persons, acting with a common intent to assist each other in violent and disorderly conduct, resulting in either injury to another person, property damage, or 'imminent danger or injury to another person or damage to property,"" as Breitbart News detailed. The law also increases penalties for assault or battery on first responders -- something that did not occur at the Florida demonstration the Herald referenced, either. Christina Pushaw, press secretary for DeSantis, told Breitbart News exclusively that the administration is going to continue to allow law enforcement to do their job, and emphasized that the demonstrations in Florida have been ""peaceful protests,"" not riots. ""Were going to let law enforcement do their jobs, as always. Weve also always urged protests to be peaceful. The demonstrations in Florida for freedom in Cuba have been peaceful protests, not riots,"" Pushaw said, adding it is not the governors role to micromanage local law enforcement agencies. ""It is not the role of the Governors office to direct the Florida Highway Patrol, or any other law enforcement agency, to conduct their day-to-day jobs protecting and serving Floridians,"" she added. Breitbart News spoke to DeSantis after he signed the anti-riot bill in April -- an action that followed sweeping calls from the left to defund police. ""The more blue an area is, the worse its governed. I mean its just a disaster what weve seen. Its always been the case kind of in my lifetime, but I think in the last year, its been exacerbated between COVID [Chinese coronavirus] lockdowns and the rioting,"" DeSantis told Breitbart News at the time. ""If you dont stand up for law enforcement, you are going to have more crimes,"" he said, explaining the law draws a line in the sand regarding defunding law enforcement. ""If they want to take money from law enforcement, I as governor and some of my Cabinet members here or there, we can veto that and make them restore the funding,"" he said. ""So that, I think that takes the defunding law enforcement off the table in Florida, which is huge."" DeSantis also explained how the law enhanced criminal penalties for those engaging in lawless behavior during a riot. ""For example, if you throw a brick, if youre in one of these violent assemblies, you throw a brick at a police officer, youre getting arrested, youre going to jail, and youre staying there until your first appearance,"" the governor said. Notably, no bricks flew at the Florida demonstration the Herald referenced. ""They are revolting against a corrupt communist dictatorship that has ruled that island with an iron fist for over 60 years, that is responsible for death and destruction, not just on the island of Cuba but really throughout the Western Hemisphere, with their actions supporting other Marxist regimes,"" DeSantis said of the protests in Cuba during a roundtable discussion Tuesday, dismissing any comparisons to the Black Lives Matter protests last year. ""These are people that are rebelling against a communist dictatorship,"" he said, adding that the current Florida demonstrations are ""fundamentally different than what we saw last summer.""",['Hannah Bleau'],7/14/2021 17:02,DeSantis Team Pushes Back After Media Blasts Cuba Protests,"['peaceful', 'media', 'desantis', 'florida', 'team', 'blasts', 'enforcement', 'protests', 'cuba', 'law', 'pushes', 'demonstrations', 'antiriot', 'youre']","The Miami Heralds editorial board published a piece Tuesday with a glaring headline loaded with suspicion: ""DeSantis anti-riot law didnt apply as Cuba protesters shut down a Miami-Dade road.

116,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/watch-biden-white-house-refuses-to-say-cubans-are-opposing-communism-psaki/,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki declined to blame communism for the current unrest in Cuba on Wednesday, when asked by Peter Doocy of Fox News whether communism was the reason that people might want to flee Cuba for the U.S. The context of Doocys question was a previous query about a statement Tuesday by Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas that Cubans and Haitians should not come to the U.S. by sea -- though the administration is making illegal entry easier through the southern land border with Mexico. The following exchange occurred during Wednesdays White House press briefing: Doocy: As the administration tries to figure out the ""root causes"" of migration to the country, dont we know that the reason people want to leave Cuba is because they dont like communism? Psaki: We- Doocy: And so as youre trying to figure out, like, what the processes are for these people who want to leave Cuba, is -- Psaki: Well, Im not sure what your question is. Doocy: You guys have spent a lot of time -- Psaki: why are people leaving Cuba, or what is the process for them getting here? I can explain either of them, but you tell me. Doocy: Sure, yeah. Do you think people are leaving Cuba because they dont like communism ? Psaki: I think weve been pretty clear that we think people are leaving Cuba, or not -- leaving Cuba, or protesting in the streets, as well, because they are opposed to the oppression, to the mismanagement of the government in the country. And we certainly support their right to protest, we support their efforts to speak out against their treatment in Cuba. I will say, separately, an important question is also what happens when people are seeking protection, or what happens when they are attempting to flee. In the past, as I noted, weve had several humanitarian programs ... But certainly, we have said many times, and I will reiterate here, that we support not just the role of the protest, and peaceful protests, we stand with the Cuban people in their call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime. Biden claimed during the 2020 election to have ""taken on the Castros of the world,"" but enthusiastically supported President Barack Obamas ""normalization"" policy with the Castro regime during his tenure as vice president. The Biden administration initially blamed the unrest in Cuba on frustration over rising COVID cases. Joel B.

117,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/biden-inaction-triggers-growing-calls-us-military-action-cuba/,"A series of tepid and inaccurate statements from President Joe Biden and his administration are meeting growing calls this week for the American government to act to prevent the further loss of life in Cuba. Protesters took the streets in dozens of municipalities nationwide in Cuba on Sunday; some estimates suggest as many as 60 cities and towns rose up demanding an end to communism. The protests were the culmination of nearly two decades of organized dissident action in the country since the Black Spring of 2003, that last major violent crackdown en masse on pro-democracy voices in the country. Protesters chanted ""freedom!"" and other anti-communist slogans, making clear their demand was an end to the 62-year-old Castro regime. The Cuban Communist Party responded by issuing an ""order of combat"" commanding all communist loyalists to take the streets and violently assault peaceful protesters. It also shut down the internet for much of this week, making international reporting on the matter extremely difficult. The little information Cubans have managed to get out of the island indicates that protests have continued daily since Sunday despite widespread reports of police gang beatings, assassinations, and deadly door-to-door raids. The violence, much of it caught on video, prompted a wave of protests nationwide in the United States in solidarity with the protesters. Cuban-Americans in every major population hub they have in the country have taken the streets in urged Biden to do more than offer verbal solidarity with their brethren. Bidens administration has so far falsely stated that the protests are about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic -- on multiple occasions -- and has taken no action in response to the situation. Biden himself issued a statement urging ""the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" without mentioning communism or socialism, the issues the protesters are actively opposing. Protesters around the country have escalated their calls for military intervention against the Castro regime to defend the lives of unarmed, peaceful Cuban protesters. In front of the White House, protesters on Monday called for ""urgent military intervention"" in remarks to Univision. In Miami, a group of protesters demanding military intervention blocked the Palmetto Expressway, the main highway in the city, on Tuesday. ""The longer we wait the more people will die. The longer that America waits to intervene the more people will die,"" one Miami protester told a local ABC News affiliate. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) made the most prominent call for U.S. military action so far on Fox News on Tuesday. ""What should be being contemplated right now is a coalition of potential military action in Cuba similar to what has happened in both administrations in both Republican and Democrat administrations,"" Suarez said. ""And Republican -- with Bush in Panama, they deposed Noriega. And that country had peaceful democracy for decades. And you had interventions by a Democratic president taking out Osama bin Laden in Pakistan."" Suarez added that airstrikes against the regime is an option ""that has to be explored and cannot be just simply discarded as an option that is not on the table."" Suarez made a similar call to action in a press conference prior to the interview this week, joined by several other prominent American politicians including Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL). At least one Democrat in the country -- the mayor of Union City, New Jersey, the largest Cuban-American enclave in the country outside of Florida -- has similarly demanded military intervention. ""We need to see action. We need to see military action,"" Mayor Brian Stack told hundreds assembled at a rally on Tuesday in New Jerseys north Hudson region. Speaking to NJ.com, Stack added, ""I believe the United States shouldve been there years ago. Just like weve liberated other countries, we should liberate Cuba, make that country free for the Cuban people. Stop all the politics all around."" A petition at Change.org urging military intervention has attracted nearly 400,000 signatures as of Wednesday, suggesting the idea is more popular than many establishment media outlets in the United States have suggested. ""The free Cubans around the world petition, without a doubt, for a MILITARY INTERVENTION by the United States of America and NATO to put an end to the Castro/Diaz-Canel regime and liberate the Cuban people who live in terror, misery, hunger and coercion!"" the petition reads in part. What such an intervention would look like is the subject of much speculation -- and much debate. The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a coalition of dissident organizations on the island, published a five-point plan to liberate Cuba on Sunday: The termination of the Regime is non-negotiable. All those involved in the peaceful civic protest must stay out in the streets and maintain their commitment to a free Cuba. All national Police and Armed Forces must support the citizens and uphold their duty to their country and not the communist regime. International intervention led by the United States in order to prevent a bloodbath. The immediate cessation of all tourism to Cuba until the dictatorship has been dismantled. Speaking to Breitbart News, Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, the director of the Assembly, listed military intervention as one of the factors in a greater plan for the U.S. government to properly aid the Cuban people. Cuban activists, he noted, must ""push for decisive international intervention led by the U.S. to protect the Cuban people and isolate and end the communist regime."" ""Intervention means decisive military action,"" Gutierrez-Boronat added. ""There are many different ways of this being done -- humanitarian assistance, but also as part of the military intervention, that is the most important and decisive."" The Assembly further demands the U.S. government not lift any sanctions against Cuba ""or its satellite regimes in the region"" (Biden already defied this one by lifting sanctions on Venezuela on Monday), help improve telecommunications on the island to prevent the regime from shutting down internet and cutting information access; and recognizing a provisional authority of members of the Cuban resistance to help guide the transition away from communism. Assembly members have been working for months on a plan to facilitate the peaceful transition away from the current regime. Over 20 organizations belonging to the Assembly organized a nationwide ""Congress of the Cuban Nation"" last month to discuss the political underpinnings of a post-communist, free Cuba, including the creation of a transition government and free and fair elections. The meetings sought to create ""a new republic -- [to] create a roadmap for transition and reconstruction of the country in all sectors.""

Marco Rubio warned Wednesday that Cuba could face a ""horrific bloodbath"" if President Biden doesnt respond to widespread protests on the Communist island -- as Cuban officials confirm at least one person was killed so far in the unrest. Rubio, a Florida Republican of Cuban descent, also slammed Twitter as ""hypocrites"" for failing to block the Cuban regime -- after famously banning former President Donald Trump. ""Im not in favor of Twitter banning anybody, but if theyre going to do it, if youre going to go after American politicians and block their tweets, censor their tweets and even deny them access to these platforms,"" he told Fox News, ""then you have to do it to a brutal dictator whos on Twitter, along with other members of the regime."" Rubio also took to Twitter himself to demand that the Biden administration take action against the Cuban Communist regime. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel urged supporters to confront the protesters. AFP via Getty Images ""What I have asked the Biden administration to do -- and I asked them two days ago to do -- is I asked them to use diplomacy that they brag about,"" Rubio said. ""Convene the United Nations, convene the Organization of American States in emergency session. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) twitter ""Pressure or shame the international community into condemning and isolating that regime, and pressure them to be prepared to take action to prevent a bloodbath,"" he said. ""Not halfway around the world, not in the Middle East, not in another continent, right here, 90 miles from our shores."" ""A horrific bloodbath is what awaits if action is not taken,"" Rubio added. ""So far the response has been weak, weak. Why?"" Rubios call to action comes after the Cuban Interior Ministry revealed that one person was killed after thousands took to the streets to demand food and freedom, NBC affiliate WTVJ-TV reported. Diubis Laurencio Tejada, 36, was killed Monday outside Havana, the outlet said. The violence on the island has sparked protests in the US as well, including Miami, which is home to the largest concentration of Cuban Americans in the country. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez on Tuesday urged the White House to consider airstrikes and a military assault on the Cuban government to aid the demonstrators. Meanwhile, Cuban government officials continue to take a hard line against the protesters, and blamed the US for inciting the unrest in the country.",['Social Links For Jorge Fitz-Gibbon'],7/14/2021 17:38,Cuba will face 'horrific bloodbath' if Biden doesn't act: Sen.

MIAMI - Graphic video out of Cuba recounts violent encounter with special units the Cuban government uses called ""Boinas Negras,"" to intimidate protestors on the communist island. It is exactly what Leticia Ramos Herreria, an outspoken member of the Ladies in White, an organization that engages in peaceful protests for freedom in Cuba, described hearing about.

She said they shot her husband and took him away in a wheelbarrow, leaving a puddle of blood inside her home, with her children present. According to another Facebook post, she later said her husband is alive. Ad Cubas Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, responded to Sundays protests, saying they were limited in scale and they were orchestrated by the United States. Rodriguez also sent the United States a warning. ""Im warning the American government that its irresponsible conduct could have grave consequences, that may damage the interest of both countries,"" said Rodriguez. On Wednesday, the Biden administration addressed how they are approaching Cuba policy, given the protests. ""Certainly the events, the protests, the reaction, the continued oppression of the Cuban people, weighs in on our decision making process,"" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. Meanwhile in South Florida, Cuban Americans continue their protests in solidarity with Cubans on the island, near Versailles Restaurant in Little Havana. They took to the Palmetto Expressway and parts of Okeechobee Road Tuesday night, saying they want to make sure that the message that Cubans on the communist island have risked their lives fighting for freedom is heard clearly in the White House and around the world.

120,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2021/07/14/marco-rubio-antony-blinken-wants-u-n-probe-on-american-racism-but-not-cuba/,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) slammed Secretary of State Antony Blinken Wednesday for inviting the United Nations to investigate racism in American while not doing ""squat to get"" the U.N. to prevent ""state sponsored murder just 90 miles off our shores"" in Cuba. ""They invite the @UN to investigate 'contemporary forms of racism in America but dont do squat to get the @UN to investigate & get involved in preventing state sponsored murder just 90 miles off our shores in #Cuba,"" Rubio tweeted Wednesday upon the announcement by the Secretary that America ""must not shrink from scrutiny"" of her ""human rights record."" ""Rather, they should be transparent with the intent to grow and do better,"" Blinken stated on Twitter. ""That is why Im announcing a formal invitation for @UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism to visit the U.S."" A few minutes later, Rubio again tweeted at Blinken by suggesting that he ask the U.N. to ""go to #Cuba where an evil socialist regime storms into peoples homes, beats the crap out of them & then drags them away?"" Rubios comments come as bloody Monday left Cuban protestors beaten and likely shot by Cuban police for protesting communism and Marxism. Fifty-seven people have either disappeared or been arrested since protests erupted throughout the island Sunday night. Breitbart News reported Tuesday a near-nationwide internet blackout severely limited the ability of protesters to share updates and images from the protest, but the little that has trickled out suggests Cuba experienced another wave of thousands-strong protests Monday that has triggered severe communist repression. Meanwhile, in America, rallies were organized to support the Cuban peoples desire for liberty in New Jersey, New York, Kentucky, Illinois, California, Ohio, Washington, DC, and Florida. In Florida Tuesday, pro-freedom protesters there shut down the Palmetto Expressway, the largest highway connecting south Florida, and have maintained a consistent presence at the historic Cuban restaurant Versailles, urging an American military intervention in the situation. The White Houses response Monday to the events were to presume that Cuban protesters yelling ""freedom!"" during anti-communist protests were actually demanding ""freedom from rising COVID cases."" ""There is a global [sic] pandemic right now, most people in that country dont have access to vaccines; thats certainly something wed love to help with,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""I would say that when people are out there on the street protesting and complaining about the lack of access to, uh, economic prosperity, uh, to the medical supplies they need to a life they deserve to live, uh, that can take on a range of meaning."" President Joe Biden also issued a statement Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people"" against their repressive communist government but failed to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security. Rubio, for his part, called on Congress Tuesday to characterize the political nature of totalitarianism in Cuba as ""communist,"" ""Marxist,"" and ""socialist."" ""We should be clear in our language,"" Rubio said on the Senate floor. ""We dont just condemn this tyranny. We condemn this communist, this Marxist, this socialist tyranny. Call it for what it is.""",['Wendell Husebø'],7/14/2021 17:49,"Rubio: Blinken Wants U.N.

121,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/cuba-video-shows-police-shoot-protester-front-toddlers/,"A video surfacing on social media Tuesday appears to show Cuban State Security special forces brutally beating and shooting a man in front of his wife and two toddlers. Miamis El Nuevo Herald identified the victim in the video as Daniel Cardenas Diaz, a 24-year-old father of three who had participated in peaceful protests against communism this week. An eyewitness recorded the video at his family home in Cardenas, Matanzas province, east of Havana. His wife, Marbely Vasquez, confirmed to the newspaper that Cardenas had participated in protests, but that he was a peaceful marcher, had not committed any violent acts, and did not stand out in his behavior among the thousands of protesters that took the streets of Cuba this weekend. The familys three children -- a pair of two-year-old twins and a 12-year-old -- were in the home when the attack occurred. Protests erupted Sunday in over 20 municipalities nationwide demanding an end to the 62-year-old communist regime and freedom for the Cuban people. Protesters used their rudimentary mobile phones and internet access to film the large assemblies and distribute images that showed the scope of rejection of the regime to the rest of the world. That evening, Castro regime head Miguel Diaz-Canel issued an ""order of combat"" encouraging civilians to take the streets and attack the protesters. The Cuban regime then shut down access to the internet to prevent word of protests from getting out, though citizens used their family connections abroad to send the word that protests continued into Wednesday throughout the island. The video of the home invasion in Cardenas first surfaced on the Facebook profile of Eduardo Perez. In addition to El Nuevo Herald and other Cuban interest publications confirming the authenticity and date of the video, the human rights group Cuban Prisoners Defenders identified the exact street the invasion occurred on and more specifically identified the victim as Joel Daniel Cardenas Diaz. The video shows shaky images of Cuban special forces, or ""black berets,"" invading a residence. A woman off-camera, presumably Vasquez, can be heard shouting, ""my children are here, I dont want them to do anything to my children."" The camera then shows Vasquez holding a toddler; the other twin can be seen standing next to her. The camera suddenly pivots in response to the arrival of a black beret and a police attack dog into the home. When the image returns, it shows a large pool of blood on the floor where the victim in question had been. Vasquez says that communist state security forces beat her husband viciously, then shot him and took him out of the home. ""Why did they do this, theres nothing in my house,"" the woman cries. ""They broke everything. They took everything. They broke everything of mine."" In addition to the uniformed regime agents, the video shows a mob of apparent civilians armed with blunt metal objects. According to Vasquez, the mob and the police officers beat Cardenas severely, causing most of the pool of blood on the floor. He sustained at least one gunshot wound. Warning - graphic images: Posibles datos del herido gravemente al ser asaltada su vivienda en Velazquez, entre Palma y Campina, Cardenas. Efectivos entraron con violencia al domicilio y dispararon a ""Joel Daniel Cardenas Diaz"" delante de su mujer y su hija ES NECESARIO CONTRASTAR:https://t.co/POBY6xJHao pic.twitter.com/B7OqlHcDCZ -- Prisoners Defenders (@CubanDefenders) July 14, 2021 El Nuevo Herald quoted Vasquez as saying that police told her they had taken her husband to a police station to receive medical care, but no confirmation exists as of Wednesday afternoon that Cardenas is alive. The attack, she said, occurred around 11 a.m. on Tuesday. It also remains unclear what police meant by receiving medical care, as they apparently told Vasquez to try to independently obtain an analgesic for her husband. The Miami newspaper also made contact with Cardenas cousin in Tampa, Orlando Leon, who said the victim remained ""incomunicado."" ""He was at the march, but if it were for that, theyd have to kill everyone; theyd have to kill the entire population of Cuba,"" Leon said. The independent Cuban online publication 14 y Medio, many reporters of which have been under effective house arrest since the protests erupted, reported Wednesday that it had evidence of at least 5,000 arrests nationwide. Authorities have not made clear if they have charged anyone with any crime. In Cuba, disagreement with the regime is officially criminal under the law banning ""disrespect"" (desacato), leading to many convictions of individuals for speaking freely about their government. To limit international condemnation of its human rights abuses, however, the regime often arrests prominent dissidents for short periods of time, beating them in police custody, and releases them without pressing charges. Some activists report being arrested on a weekly basis, essentially resulting in an extended restriction on their freedoms without due process. Police, the newspaper added, appeared to be especially pursuing journalists, members of political dissident organizations, and civilians with a known social media footprint of criticism of the government. The Castro regime identified one person killed in the protests, 36-year-old Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, on Tuesday; dissident organizations fear the death toll is far higher given multiple instances documented of police opening fire on peaceful crowds in major cities. Hundreds of people also reportedly remain missing, raising concerns regarding their health. The Cuban regime claims the protests are a fabrication by the U.S. government, an allegation for which it has produced no credible evidence.

Ron DeSantis suggested Tuesday that Florida-based companies should attempt to provide internet access to Cuba after the communist country shut off the internet to suppress recent protests and dissent. ""What does the regime do when you start to see these images?"" DeSantis said during a press conference referring to videos coming out of Cuba showing violent government crackdowns against anti-communist protesters in the streets. ""They shut down the internet. They dont want the truth to be out, they dont want people to be able to communicate."" LIVE UPDATES: CUBA'S CRACKDOWN DOESN'T SILENCE PROTESTERS, GOVERNMENT CONFIRMS 1 MAN DEAD DeSantis continued, ""And so one of the things I think we should be able to do with our private companies or with the United States is to provide some of that internet via satellite. We have companies on the Space Coast that launch these things."" The Florida Republican said that he would reach out to some Florida internet providers to ""see what are the options"" to make his plan a reality. DeSantiss office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. CUBAN AMERICAN PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN EXPRESSWAY IN MIAMI, BLAME BIDEN FOR LACK OF SUPPORT Thousands of Cubans have taken to the streets to oppose the communist government that has had a stranglehold on power for the last six decades, and the government reported that at least one person has died. Cubas president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has blamed the United States for the turmoil and called for his supporters to take to the streets to fight back against the protests . ""We are prepared to do anything,"" he said. ""We will be battling in the streets."" The unrest in Cuba has spilled into the United States, where protesters in support of Cuban independence took to the streets in Tampa, Florida and called on President Biden to take action . ""Where is Biden?"" the protesters could be heard chanting. ""Where is Biden?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden released a statement earlier this week that said, ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime."" On Tuesday, Bidens Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned Cubans that if they attempt to flee the island nation they will not be welcomed into the United States and will instead be settled somewhere else. ""The time is never right to attempt migration by sea,"" Mayorkas said at a press conference. ""To those who risk their lives doing so, this risk is not worth taking. Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States.""",['Andrew Miller'],7/14/2021 19:19,DeSantis calls on Florida companies to provide internet to Cuba after government shuts it down,"['shuts', 'states', 'streets', 'desantis', 'united', 'florida', 'fox', 'internet', 'cuba', 'calls', 'shut', 'companies', 'provide', 'protesters']","Ron DeSantis suggested Tuesday that Florida-based companies should attempt to provide internet access to Cuba after the communist country shut off the internet to suppress recent protests and dissent.

123,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/white-house-may-ease-ban-remittances-part-cuba-review-sources-2021-07-14/,"WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's review of Trump-era Cuba policy could lead to big changes in the U.S. posture toward the communist government in Havana as U.S. officials take stock of large protests in that country. The White House says Biden's primary goal is helping the people of Cuba as they reel from pandemic-driven economic woes. Two sources familiar with the review said on Wednesday it could lead to the easing of restrictions on payments Americans can make to their families in Cuba. Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually, representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism.

Biden is also considering reviving the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, which had provided a legal way for Cuban families to be reunited in the United States, the sources said. Trump's withdrawal of U.S. diplomats from Cuba in 2017 in response to mysterious, possibly sonic, attacks on Americans in Havana basically froze the reunification program. Cuban-born Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday warned Cubans and Haitians not to attempt to enter the United States illegally by sea, saying the trek was too dangerous and they would be repatriated. read more The Cuba review is being coordinated by the White House National Security Council with input from the State and Defense departments as well as the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. The outcome of the review is not considered imminent. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters the Cuba policy review is being conducted ""with an eye toward its impact on the political and economic well-being of the Cuban people."" ""There's no question that the protests over the weekend and the events of the last several days are significant events, and it was the largest protest we've seen in Cuba in a long time. That will obviously have an impact on how we proceed,"" she said. to Cuba Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Reporting By Steve Holland; editing by Patricia Zengerle and Alistair Bell Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",['Steve Holland'],7/14/2021 20:48,White House may ease ban on remittances as part of Cuba review -sources,"['security', 'states', 'white', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'house', 'ease', 'ban', 'unlimited', 'remittances', 'review', 'united', 'sources']","The White House says Biden's primary goal is helping the people of Cuba as they reel from pandemic-driven economic woes.

124,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/14/cubans-rally-in-florida-communism-the-last-thing-you-want-for-a-country-like-america/,"NAPLES, Florida - Hundreds of Cubans gathered in south Florida on Tuesday to protest -- not the lack of medical supplies in Cuba -- but the brutal communist regime abusing their family and friends back home. Cuban and American flags filled the streets of downtown Naples as protesters joined others around the country and in Cuba to oppose a dictatorship that has gripped the island since 1959, when Fidel Castro took over. ""It is misinformation that COVID [Chinese coronavirus] and hunger is causing the protests in Cuba. Thats not the truth. People are tired of the government. They are tired of not being free, and thats what they are fighting for,"" said protester and local singer Yenier Alvarino, who is part of a musical duo with Adrian Arteaga called Arteaga y El Yen. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in at least 20 provinces in Cuba on Sunday to peacefully demand the end of communism. The waves of discontent were captured on social media, which helped Cubans communicate across the country and band together for the islands largest demonstration in decades. Though protests have continued, hundreds of people are likely missing and police have reportedly peppered crowds with bullets to subdue opposition. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead of the Castro regime, responded to the protests by urging ""revolutionaries"" to violently assault unarmed protesters on the streets, describing his call as an ""order of combat,"" Breitbart News reported. In response to Diaz-Canels order, both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers have unleashed a wave of repression on protesters that has included shooting at them, attacking them with dogs, and public beatings. The regime also appeared to shut down internet access to stem the flow of ""citizen journalist videos depicting extreme repression."" "" Yes I do -- we all do,"" Arteaga said at the Naples protest when Breitbart News asked if he still has family in Cuba. Arteaga said he came to the United States when he was 18 years old ""looking for freedom."" Naples, which is two hours across the state from Miami, has a relatively large Cuban population. Many families move to the beachside town in search of a more suburban lifestyle than Miami offers, and most have relatives and friends still in Cuba. ""Its really hard. Some of our families only communicate to us through WhatsApp and Facebook. When the internet shuts down, its really hard to get ahold of them. Thats what they do, they cut down the internet,"" Arteaga said. Arteaga noted that while the pandemic has ravaged an already-faltering healthcare system in Cuba, increased disease, death, and destruction only brought the country to a ""tipping point"" after more than 60 years of abuse. ""People are dying of COVID. People are dying of other conditions and they have to stay at home. They have to keep their dead relatives at home because there are no supplies in the morgues. There are no supplies in the hospitals. The power goes off and the generators in the hospitals dont work and people die,"" he said. ""Everything, infrastructure, everything in Cuba -- its at the lowest limit right now. Thats what were seeing right now, but its always been low. People got tired of it."" President Joe Biden avoided explicitly condemning communism and Marxist ideology in a Monday statement, though he claimed to ""stand with the Cuban people."" Marxism is the philosophical underpinning of communism, the ruling political system in Cuba, and has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people over several decades. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Cuban protesters yelling ""freedom!"" during anti-communist protests could have actually been demanding ""freedom from rising COVID cases."" On Wednesday, Psaki again declined to blame unrest in Cuba on communism, Breitbart News reported. ""People want a new system, a democratic system. We have a dictatorship in Cuba, and we have been having that for years and years,"" Arteaga said. ""Thats why people are protesting in the streets in Cuba, and thats why they are giving their lives in Cuba to the hands of the police and the army. They want a radical change in the government of Cuba."" American corporate media also falsely asserted that the protests were a response to the nations handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic or economic woes, even as protesters were caught on camera saying slogans such as, ""down with communism,"" ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" among other anti-government statements. ""I dont understand why theres been so much silence on the left on this particular point with regard to whats happening. We can talk about the vice president, Kamala Harris, going down to Guatemala and places like that where shes not wanted, supposedly to address the root cause of immigration issues, when we have a humanitarian crisis 45 minutes away from here, and theres been utter silence,"" said Drew-Montez Clark, a U.S. Representative candidate for District 25 in Florida. ""We need to call [communism] for what it is. ... We have the radical left in this country that wants to move toward that authoritarianism. They want to move toward socialism and communism. But we have a perfect example in Cuba of what that turns into,"" Clark continued, as he waved an American flag at the Tuesday protest. Many in the crowd, some who braved dangerous waters in flimsy rafts to escape communism in Cuba, expressed the same concerns about the direction of the United States. ""I would say to all of you: communism sounds pretty when you talk about it if you want to promote it,"" Arteaga said. ""You can read it in a book and it is beautiful,"" Alvarino joined in. ""But in real life, it is suffering. It degrades a society. It oppresses the ones that are not on top, the ones that are not part of the [leadership.],"" Arteaga continued. ""Coming from a communist country, I can tell you, thats the last thing you want for a country like America. Thats what many countries in the world are trying to fight against."" Arteaga said Americans must be very watchful of the government and the culture to make sure communism does not gain a foothold in the United States. ""Dont believe the good things they say about communism. Its not real,"" he concluded. ""This country is beautiful the way it is okay? Dont change it,"" Alvarino added. ""We are working good -- this is the best country in the world. So, God Bless America.""",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/14/2021 22:15,"Cubans Rally in South Florida, Denounce Communism","['system', 'streets', 'rally', 'south', 'florida', 'communism', 'regime', 'protests', 'cuba', 'thats', 'cubans', 'country', 'denounce', 'protesters', 'arteaga']","NAPLES, Florida - Hundreds of Cubans gathered in south Florida on Tuesday to protest -- not the lack of medical supplies in Cuba -- but the brutal communist regime abusing their family and friends back home.

126,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/cuba-protests-arrested-police-target-religious-leaders/,"Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people since protests against communism erupted in Cuba on Sunday, a total including those known to be under investigation but not the disappeared. The human rights group Cuban Prisoners Defenders submitted a list of 162 people to the United Nations on Wednesday suspected of being the victims of forced disappearances, meaning their families have reported them missing, but police have not confirmed their arrest. Cuban police regularly detain individuals perceived to be opposed to the Communist Party for participating in peaceful protests, practicing journalism, or being involved with religious groups not controlled by the Party. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights, a non-governmental organization, revealed in a report published this month that Cuba has enacted over 30,000 arbitrary arrests against perceived dissidents in the last five years. Protests erupted in Cuba on Sunday calling for an end to the communist regime. The protests attracted thousands of people in nearly every major city in the country - spanning the entire island - and prompted Cuban police to respond by opening fire on protesters, beating them publicly, using attack dogs to maul them, and otherwise violently repressing them. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who represents the public face of the Castro family regime, also called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued late Sunday. The Cuban independent news outlet 14 y Medio reported on Wednesday that it could confirm, citing civil society organizations, ""over 5,000 people imprisoned or under investigation"" as a direct result of Sundays protests, among them a disproportionate number of journalists and pro-democracy activists. It noted that the regimes internet shutdown made it much more difficult to communicate across the island, so there are likely a high number of others who participated in protests but remain incommunicado or whose relatives have not been able to reach journalists to report them missing. Cuban citizens throughout the country have also expressed concerns over the potential deaths of their loved ones. Reports on social media suggest that hospitals are not allowing family members to visit patients in the hospital recovering from bullet wounds, leaving unclear their health status. The communist regime admitted to one death during the protests on Wednesday, a man identified as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda. Authorities did not reveal a cause of death in his case. The statement in which the Ministry of Interior revealed the death also accused protesters of attempting to attack a police station. In addition to targeting journalists and members of known civil society groups, Cuban regime agents have assaulted and detained religious leaders. The most prominent case so far of such an assault occurred in Camaguey where Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, a Catholic priest who had prominently criticized the regime, received a public beating before going missing for nearly 24 hours. Alvarez resurfaced late Monday after an international campaign demanding to know his whereabouts. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) documented several other targeted attacks on religious leaders on the island in a statement on Tuesday. ""Those reported as detained include Yeremi Blanco and Yarian Sierra, two pastors from the Berean Baptist Mission in Matanza and Reverend Yusniel Perez Montejo of the Eastern Baptist Convention,"" USCIRF noted. ""Cuban authorities are detaining religious leaders merely for peacefully protesting and calling for greater respect for human rights,"" USCIRF Commissioner James W. Carr said in a statement. ""Principal among human rights concerns in Cuba are the ongoing and systematic violations of religious freedom, which include the persistent intimidation and harassment of religious leaders."" The Global Liberty Alliance, a group that does extensive legal work to protect the faithful on the island, also shared reports on Tuesday that members of the Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba, or Free Yorubas, also went missing during the protests. The Yoruba are a Nigerian ethnic group; Cuban Yorubas are practitioners of a hybrid Cuban religion that blends Yoruba paganism with Spanish Catholicism known commonly as santeria. The Cuban regime heavily regulates santeria and persecutes those who practice it outside of the auspices of Party-approved priests. The Global Liberty Alliance denounced on Tuesday that members of the Free Yorubas reported and outsized police presence outside of the residences of some of the most prominent members.  ALERT GLA has received word that the #FreeYorubas of #Cuba may be under arrest. The Free Yorubas report that 3 police vans have arrived to arrest up to 15 people sheltering in a home. @USCIRF pic.twitter.com/U0P2VaAZ8c -- The Global Liberty Alliance (@GLALegalDefense) July 12, 2021 As of Wednesday, the Global Liberty Alliance also reported the disappearance of a Methodist pastor, Carlos Raul Macias Lopez, and his family. While Christians on the island face significant persecution, the Vatican has not yet issued any substantive statement on the protests or the state violence in response to them as of Wednesday. Pope Francis has visited Cuba with the blessing of the Communist Party, receiving praise from Fidel Castro. Most Christians remaining in Cuba identify as Catholic. The Conference of Catholic Bishops of Cuba issued a statement on Tuesday stopping short of condemning the government for the wave of violence it unleashed on its people. ""We understand that the government has responsibilities and has tried to take measures to improve the difficulties [faced by the country],"" the statement read in part, ""but we also understand that the people have a right to manifest their needs, desires, and hopes and, at the same time, publicly express how some measures taken are seriously affecting them.""

Lee Lecture on international affairs, roasted the Democrats for being ""hesitant"" to ""criticize their communist friends in Cuba."" Before Pence started his speech, he took a few moments to acknowledge what is going on in Cuba, saying it is ""On the minds of freedom-loving people around the world."" ""As we gather today, the people of Cuba are taking to the streets, once again, for the ideals of freedom,"" Pence said. ""For more than 60 years, the people of Cuba have labored under a communist dictatorship. It has stifled their liberty, silenced voices of dissent, and squandered their future,"" the former vice president added. Pence continued that, ""While some of the far-left are hesitant to criticize their communist friends in Cuba. ... The American people stand with the courageous men and woman of Cuba that are marching to reclaim their history of 'Libertad.'"" ""The United States must always stand for a free and Democratic Cuba,"" Pence emphasized. ""It must always be, que viva Cuba libre."" In the days leading up to Pences speech, thousands of Cubans have peacefully flooded the streets in Cuba, demanding there be an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. Some people were also seen chanting ""freedom"" and wearing American flags, while many are seeing extreme police repression. There have also been thousands of Cuban-Americans in the United States who have organized ""free Cuba"" rallies, which are meant encourage Cubans who are on the island to stay in the streets to peacefully demand an end to communism. Many are also trying to draw attention to President Joe Biden and his administration to act.",['Jacob Bliss'],7/14/2021 23:53,Pence: Dems 'Are Hesitant to Criticize Their Communist Friends in Cuba',"['dems', 'streets', 'president', 'states', 'friends', 'communist', 'vice', 'thousands', 'hesitant', 'cuba', 'pence', 'criticize', 'stand', 'united']","Former Vice President Mike Pence, while speaking at the Heritage Foundations annual B.C.

129,https://www.foxnews.com/world/cubas-president-admits-government-shortcomings-some-blame-for-protests,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who days ago called on revolutionaries to counter anti-government protesters in the streets, acknowledged Wednesday government shortcomings in the lead-up to the unrest in the country. Diaz-Canel, who has been widely criticized for the countrys violent crackdown and Internet blackouts, gave a televised address Wednesday night and acknowledged that his government failures played a role in the protests over food shortages and other problems. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" Historic protests broke out across Cuba on Sunday night. Diaz-Canel, who heads the Communist Party, seemed uninterested in making any concessions. He placed the blame squarely on the U.S. for stoking resentment and called the protesters mercenaries. At one point, he said, ""The order to fight has been given--into the street, revolutionaries!"" PITBULL SPEAKS OUT IN SUPPORT OF PROTESTERS Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. Some protesters have demanded a change in government, so although Diaz-Canel seemed to tone down the rhetoric, it remains to be seen if there will be any concessions by the government. CUBAN AMERICAN PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN EXPRESSWAY IN MIAMI, BLAME BIDEN FOR LACK OF SUPPORT The true extent of the countrys crackdown is unclear due to reports of blocked internet access. The New York Times, citing Amnesty International, reported on Tuesday that at least 150 were detained. There were other reports of some protesters being unaccounted for. Diaz-Canel on Wednesday urged Cubans to not act with hate. DEM SOCIALISTS ALSO MUM ON PROTESTS Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida Republican, suggested Tuesday that Florida-based companies should attempt to provide Internet access to Cuba after the communist country shut off the internet to suppress recent protests and dissent. ""What does the regime do when you start to see these images?"" DeSantis said during a press conference . ""They shut down the internet. They dont want the truth to be out, they dont want people to be able to communicate.""

130,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-lifts-food-medicine-customs-restrictions-after-protests-2021-07-15/,"People shout slogans against the government during a protest against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo HAVANA, July 14 (Reuters) - Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on the amount of food and medicine travelers could bring into the country in an apparent small concession to demands by protesters who took to the street last weekend. Thousands joined a wave of nationwide protests over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the government's handling of a surge in COVID-19 infections on Sunday, in the most significant unrest in decades in the Communist-run country. The government blamed the unrest on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardship caused by the decades-old U.S. trade embargo that Washington tightened in the midst of the pandemic, pushing the Cuban economy to the brink. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Several countries and the United Nations have called on the government to respect citizens' right to express themselves. Others like Mexico have said the best way to help the Cuban people would be for the United States to ease sanctions. loading In Cuba, a growing number of high-profile artists from salsa band Los Van Van to jazz pianist Chucho Valdes have criticized the authorities handling of the unrest, urging them to listen to protesters rather than fight them. Intermittent internet outages that activists say were designed to tamp any further unrest eased slightly on Wednesday although access to social media and messaging services remained restricted. Officials have blamed a campaign on social media under the hashtag #SOSCuba calling for humanitarian aid for fueling the protests, saying it was launched by U.S.-backed mercenaries seeking to destabilize the Communist-run country. They compared the push to a U.S.-backed effort to send relief to Venezuela in 2019 that ended in a violent standoff on the Colombian border. loading Still, one of the campaign's demands was for the government to lift customs restrictions on food, medicine and hygiene products that are lacking in the country amid its worst economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union. And Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said on Wednesday the government would do precisely that from next Monday, lifting restrictions until the year-end. ""It was a demand made by many travelers and it was necessary to take this decision,"" he said on a roundtable on state television, alongside President Miguel Diaz-Canel. It was not immediately clear how much difference the move would make given that there are very few flights at the moment into the Caribbean island nation which is going through its worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic. Government critic Yoani Sanchez, who runs news website 14ymedio, was quick to tweet that such concessions would not be enough to appease those who had protested on Sunday. ""We do not want crumbs, we want freedom, and we want it nowwwww,"" she wrote. ""The streets have spoken: we are not afraid."" Cubans say they have been frustrated by outages in mobile internet and restricted access to social media and messaging platforms since Sunday. ""It's been a bunch of days that noone has been able to connect,"" said Havana resident Andrea Lopez. ""My husband is in Mexico and I haven't been able to speak with him."" More than 200 people were detained during or following the protests, according to exiled rights group Cubalex, and only a handful have been released so far. Diaz-Canel said there were three kinds of protesters; counter-revolutionaries, criminals and those with legitimate frustrations. State-run television showed images of a crowd looting a store and another attacking an empty police car. Interior ministry officials said in a program televised later that some of the detained would be pursued for crimes like incitement to violence, contempt, robbery and damage to public property, which carry lengthy prison sentences.

131,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/cubas-president-government-blame-protests-78855031,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has acknowledged shortcomings in his governments handling of shortages and of neglecting certain sectors, but he is urging Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to violence during recent street protests HAVANA -- Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Wednesday acknowledged shortcomings in his government's handling of shortages and of neglecting certain sectors, but he urged Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to violence during recent street protests. Until now, the Cuban government had only blamed social media and the U.S. government for the weekend protests, which were the biggest seen in Cuba since a quarter century ago, when then-President Fidel Castro personally went into the streets to calm crowds of thousands furious over dire shortages following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its economic subsidies for the island. In a nighttime address on state television, Diaz-Canel for the first time was self critical and acknowledged that failings by the state played a role in the protests over food shortages, rising prices and other grievances. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" In the protests, many Cubans expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines, as well as repeated electricity outages. Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against the coronavirus. But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades. Police moved in and arrested dozens of protesters, sometimes violently, and the government has accused protesters of looting and vandalizing shops. Smaller protests continued Monday and officials reported at least one death. No incidents were reported Wednesday. ""Our society is not a society that generates hatred and those people acted with hatred,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""The feeling of Cubans is a feeling of solidarity and these people carried out these armed acts, with vandalism ... yelling for deaths ... planning to raid public places, breaking, robbing, throwing stones."" Authorities did not report the number of people arrested, Col. Moraima Bravet of the Interior Ministry said Wednesday only that they are mostly between the ages of 25 and 37 and will be prosecuted such crimes as public disorder, assault, contempt, robbery or damage. Cuba is suffering its worst crisis in years from a combination of the coronavirus pandemic that has paralyzed its economy, including the vital tourism industry, inefficiencies in the state-run economy and the tightening of U.S. sanctions on the island. The administration of President Donald Trump imposed more than 200 measures against the island in four years. Diaz-Canel said that this ""complex situation"" was taken advantage of ""by those who do not really want the Cuban revolution to develop or a civilized relationship with respect with the United States."" Shortly before the presidents remarks, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced some measures such as customs flexibility for Cuban citizens who go on foreign trips to bring home toiletries, food and medicines, which are among the most hard to find items in Cuba. Marrero also said that work is being done to improve the stability of the national electricity system and that officials will seek to improve the supply of medicines, many of which are produced on the island but whose inputs must be imported. Meanwhile, Economy Minister Alejandro Gil announced the directors of state-owned enterprises will be allowed to determine salaries beyond the regulations. He also said that in the coming weeks long-promised rules will be instituted for small- and medium-size enterprises to be formed, a step once unthinkable under the communist government.","['Abc News', 'The Associated Press', 'July']",7/15/2021 3:23,Cuba's president says government has some blame for protests,"['díazcanel', 'president', 'food', 'medicines', 'cuban', 'protests', 'island', 'blame', 'shortages', 'cubans', 'cubas', 'economy']","In a nighttime address on state television, Diaz-Canel for the first time was self critical and acknowledged that failings by the state played a role in the protests over food shortages, rising prices and other grievances.

132,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/15/miami-sos-cuba-protesters-march-from-versailles-to-freedom-tower/,"MIAMI - Miami SOS Cuba protesters marched Wednesday night from Versailles in Little Havana to the historic Freedom Tower in downtown Miami. Miami police officers escorted the group as they walked eastbound on Eighth Street to get to the building that housed the former U.S Cuban Assistance Center from 1962 to 1974. Officers blocked intersections to allow the group to turn northbound toward Biscayne Boulevard. They passed by Bayfront Park, near to where a group of boaters with U.S. and Cuban flags had met earlier. It was a five-mile journey. They arrived at the 17-story Spanish Renaissance-style building at 600 Biscayne Blvd. to continue their protest. Some of the Cuban-American children have heard stories about the exodus. Fidel Castro was imposing communist policies when their ancestors escaped the island with whatever they could carry. The U.S. granted them political asylum and assistance for healthcare and housing. Ad The area where Miami Heat fans now gather before games became known as the ""Ellis Island of the South."" The sudden wave of refugees turned it into the ""Refugio"" camp. Some slept on the floor, as they waited for their turn to be processed. More than half a century later, Cubans who protested on the island Sunday say they are tired of the authoritarian communist regime and they want political change. They are dealing with shortages of food and medicine, power outages, internet connectivity issues, and COVID patients dying at home. Protesters in Miami chanted on their behalf for a ""Free Cuba!"" The dry-foot, wet-foot policy that protected Cubans who arrived by boat is gone. Helping refugees is not the priority it once was during the Cold War. Some of the participants of the Miami march said they want President Joe Biden to help Cubans get rid of communism for good.

133,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/black-lives-matter-blames-us-praises-cuban-regime-social-media-erupts,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Black Lives Matter faced fierce criticism late Wednesday after posting a statement that blasted the U.S. and praised Cuba's government while the island was destabilized by historic protests and violent crackdowns. The statement - originally posted on Instagram and later tweeted and retweeted - blamed the U.S. embargo for the country's instability and credited the Cuban government for historically granting ""Black revolutionaries"" asylum. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, was quick to rebuke an initial tweet that linked to the statement. ""The extortionist ring known as the Black Lives Matter organization took a break today from shaking down corporations for millions & buying themselves mansions to share their support for the Communist regime in #Cuba,"" Rubio tweeted. CLICK FOR LIVE UPDATES ON CUBA The BLM statement was sent out at about the time Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel admitted in a televised address that his governments failures played a role in the protests over food shortages and other issues. He had earlier called on ""revolutionaries"" to counter the anti-government protesters. PITBULL PLEADS FOR HELP FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc.s tweet echoed Diaz-Canels early statements that blamed the U.S. embargo for the countrys economic devastation. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades and is also facing a resurgence of coronavirus cases. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday denied claims that the U.S. was to blame. He said Cuba faces a long list of problems. He said Cubans are tired of living under a mismanaged economy. ""That is what we are hearing and seeing in Cuba, and that is a reflection of the Cuban people, not of the United States or any other outside actor,"" he said. BLM called for the U.S. to lift the sanctions that are ""cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis."" Cuba is being ""punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" the statement read. The group said Cuba has been an ally with ""oppressed peoples of African descent"" and praised the countrys effort to protect ""Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur."" (Shakur, also known as JoAnne Chesimard, was convicted of being an accomplice in the 1973 slaying of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster, who left behind a wife and 3-year-old son. Shakur later escaped prison and fled to Cuba, where former Cuban leader Fidel Castro granted her asylum.) The BLM statement underscores the tense political climate in the U.S. regarding Cuba. Many Republicans and Democrats have been forceful in their support of the anti-government protesters. Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, the son of a Cuban immigrant, took to Twitter on Sunday in support of the thousands of protesters. He posted a video that showed dozens in front of the Communist Party headquarters and said the current regime will be ""consigned to the dustbin of history."" ""It has brutalized & denied freedom to generations of Cubans, and forced my family & so many others to flee,"" he tweeted. ""The American people stand squarely with the men & women of Cuba and their noble fight for liberty."" President Biden also called the protests ""historic"" and a ""clarion call,"" but his detractors say the White House has not gone far enough to support the protesters. The progressive wing of the Democrat Party -- many of whom align themselves with BLM regarding policy -- seem unsure on how to react to the protests, subsequent violent crackdowns and Internet blackouts. BERNIE SANDERS' LONG HISTORY OF PRAISING CUBA'S COMMUNISTS The BLM statement was widely panned on social media. The group did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News shortly after a Politico reporter posted the statement. Giancarlo Sopo, a communication strategist who once worked on former President Trumps re-election campaign, called the tweet ""disgusting."" ""Despite the Cuban dictatorships murdering and beating of protestors (many of them Black), BLMs statement on Cuba...condemns the U.S., praises the Castro regime, and makes no mention of the atrocities being committed by the dictatorship,"" he tweeted. Joe Walsh, the former Illinois Republican, called the statement ""way worse than embarrassing."" Hillel C. Neuer, the Canadian-born international lawyer, tweeted, ""@Blklivesmatter just sided with the oppressors."" The true extent of the countrys crackdown is unclear due to reports of blocked internet access. The New York Times, citing Amnesty International, reported on Tuesday that at least 150 were detained. There were other reports of some protesters being unaccounted for. Last month, for the 29th year, the United Nations General Assembly voted against the six-decade embargo, according to the New York Times. Rodney Hunter, the political coordinator at the U.S. Mission to the U.N., reportedly said the U.S. supports the Cuban people. GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Sanctions are one set of tools in our broader effort toward Cuba to advance democracy, promote respect for human rights, and help the Cuban people exercise the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" he said, according to the paper.

Demonstrators voiced grievances on Sunday against goods shortages, rising prices and power cuts, and some called for a change of government. (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel for the first time is offering some self-criticism while saying that government shortcomings in handling shortages and other problems played a role in this weeks protests. But in a televised address Wednesday night he also called on Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to the violence that occurred at some of the rare street demonstrations in which protesters voiced grievances over high prices, food shortages and power outages, while some people also called for a change in the government. Until now, the Cuban government had only blamed social media and the U.S. government for the weekend protests, which were the biggest seen in Cuba since a quarter century ago, when then-President Fidel Castro personally went into the streets to calm crowds of thousands furious over dire shortages following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its economic subsidies for the island. ADVERTISEMENT Diaz-Canel, however, said that failings by the state played a role in the unrest. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" In the protests, many Cubans expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines, as well as repeated electricity outages. Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against the coronavirus. But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades. Police moved in and arrested dozens of protesters, sometimes violently, and the government has accused protesters of looting and vandalizing shops. Smaller protests continued Monday and officials reported at least one death. No incidents were reported Wednesday. ""Our society is not a society that generates hatred and those people acted with hatred,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""The feeling of Cubans is a feeling of solidarity and these people carried out these armed acts, with vandalism ... yelling for deaths ... planning to raid public places, breaking, robbing, throwing stones."" Authorities did not report the number of people arrested, Col. Moraima Bravet of the Interior Ministry said Wednesday only that they are mostly between the ages of 25 and 37 and will be prosecuted such crimes as public disorder, assault, contempt, robbery or damage. Cuba is suffering its worst crisis in years from a combination of the coronavirus pandemic that has paralyzed its economy, including the vital tourism industry, inefficiencies in the state-run economy and the tightening of U.S. sanctions on the island. The administration of President Donald Trump imposed more than 200 measures against the island in four years. Diaz-Canel said that this ""complex situation"" was taken advantage of ""by those who do not really want the Cuban revolution to develop or a civilized relationship with respect with the United States."" ADVERTISEMENT Shortly before the presidents remarks, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced some measures such as customs flexibility for Cuban citizens who go on foreign trips to bring home toiletries, food and medicines, which are among the most hard to find items in Cuba. Marrero also said that work is being done to improve the stability of the national electricity system and that officials will seek to improve the supply of medicines, many of which are produced on the island but whose inputs must be imported. Meanwhile, Economy Minister Alejandro Gil announced the directors of state-owned enterprises will be allowed to determine salaries beyond the regulations. He also said that in the coming weeks long-promised rules will be instituted for small- and medium-size enterprises to be formed, a step once unthinkable under the communist government.",[],7/15/2021 4:08,Cuba's leader lays some blame for protests on his government,"['prices', 'voiced', 'called', 'national', 'lays', 'power', 'leader', 'change', 'cuban', 'protests', 'blame', 'shortages', 'cubas', 'protesters']","A truck of special forces police sits parked outside National Capitol building in Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, July 14, 2021, days after protests.

135,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/15/hundreds-of-miamis-sos-cuba-protesters-sing-patria-y-vida-in-little-havana/,"MIAMI - A nostalgic protest song in Spanish reverberated Wednesday night on Miamis Calle Ocho. The lyrics of ""Patria y Vida,"" Spanish for ""Homeland and Life,"" antagonize a more than half-a-century old Cuban government propaganda slogan. The song urging Cubans to ""no longer shout 'Homeland and death! But, 'Homeland and life!"" took a different meaning on the communist island during the coronavirus pandemic. For Cuban Americans, the lyrics had more meaning after the uprising Sunday. SOS Cuba protesters meet Wednesday in Little Havana to watch Gente De Zona, or GDZ, perform a 'Patria Y Vida' song that became the anthem of the Sunday uprising in Cuba. During the free concert in Little Havana, hundreds sang together. Some were in tears. Attendees said it wasnt a party. Some said they participated in the ""exercise on freedom of speech"" after work to speak up for their relatives in Cuba who are being censored with violence. ""It cant remain like this. The United States government has to do something,"" Musician Alexander Delgado said in Spanish. Ad Delgado was standing next to his fellow members of Gente De Zona, Yotuel Omar Manzanarez Romero and Randy Malcom. They produced the song with Maykel ""El Osorbo"" Castillo, and El Funky de Cuba, both members of Havanas The San Isidro Movement against censorship. ""We raised our voices for freedom in Cuba,"" Malcom said in Spanish in a video he published on Instagram after the concert. Members of Gente De Zona, or GDZ, Alexander Delgado, right, Yotuel Omar, center, and Randy Malcom, left, talk to Local 10 News Reporter Christian De La Rosa Wednesday in Miami's Little Havana. (Copyright 2020 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.) Others at the event said they wanted to remind U.S. officials that there are Americans of Cuban descent who want the U.S. to intervene because Cubans need political change. Estefani Moncada held up a ""No More Communism"" sign that she made at home and said she trusts God and ""the good people"" will help Cubans. Ad ""I trust the president that we have. I didnt vote for him but I trust him,"" Moncada said. Opposition leaders on the island report some Cubans with COVID are dying at home without access to healthcare. Cuban Americans said their relatives are dealing with shortages of food and medicine, power outages, old pipes that pollute the water, and an authoritarian regime that uses trained special forces units to brutally arrest protesters at their homes.

136,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-defends-cuba-policy-official-rubio-criticism,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The State Department defended its head of Cuba policy, saying both the U.S. and Cuba are better for her service despite Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., claiming she was responsible for the Biden administration's ""weak"" response to how the Cuban government is treating its people. In a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Rubio called on President Biden to take charge by leading the international community in pressuring the Cuban government to ease its crackdown on protesters. The senator called the administration's response ""weak"" thus far, and asserted that this would not change as long as the current lead official on Cuba policy - Deputy Assistant Secretary Emily Mendrala - is in charge. BLACK LIVES MATTER BLAMES US, PRAISES CUBAN REGIME, SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS The State Department responded with a full-throated endorsement of Mendrala and her capabilities. ""Deputy Assistant Secretary Mendrala has years of experience - at the State Department, White House, and on Capitol Hill -- working to support human rights and advance the cause of democracy in Cuba,"" the State Department said. ""The American and Cuban people are better off because of her continued public service."" CUBA'S PRESIDENT ADMITS TO SHORTCOMINGS; TAKES SOME BLAME FOR PROTESTS Rubio said Mendrala's history includes ""supporting engagement"" with Cuba, including planning trips for members of Congress to meet members of the Cuban government. Mendrala's State Department bio confirms she has ""led educational travel delegations"" to Cuba for members of Congress and others. Rubio, who is Cuban American, has been a vocal supporter of the protesters as they face retaliation from their own government. On Wednesday, he called on Biden to help Cubans by authorizing funding for emergency internet connectivity, as the government has restricted internet access for its people in response to the protests. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Florida Republican also called for Biden to convene the Organization of American States and the United Nations in order to collectively pressure Cuba to cease its actions against its people.",['Ronn Blitzer'],7/15/2021 9:57,State Department defends Cuba policy official after Rubio blames her for admin's 'weak' response,"['state', 'policy', 'called', 'rubio', 'biden', 'cuban', 'department', 'mendrala', 'members', 'cuba', 'weak', 'official', 'defends', 'american', 'response', 'blames']","The State Department defended its head of Cuba policy, saying both the U.S. and Cuba are better for her service despite Sen.

137,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/15/w-h-o-susidiary-discourages-cuba-protests-over-coronavirus/,"The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), the Americas subsidiary of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), discouraged anti-communist protests in Cuba in a statement Wednesday, claiming they elevate the risk of spreading Chinese coronavirus. PAHOs statement appeared to contradict the W.H.O.s active support of riots in the United States throughout summer 2020 in response to alleged racism in the country. At the time, W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded to mass assemblies of people, many of them violent, by asserting that his agency ""fully supports equality and the global movement against racism."" Unlike in summer 2020, however, many countries of the world now have access to experimental vaccines, many of which have shown a significant ability to limit the spread of Chinese coronavirus. The Cuban communist regime claims to have two vaccine candidates in advanced development and began pediatric clinical trials for one of them, the ""Abdala"" experiment, on Thursday. PAHO is currently embroiled in legal litigation over its ties to the Castro regime. Cuban slave doctors forced to work in Brazil sued the agency in 2018 for signing onto an agreement between Cuba and the then-socialist government of Brazil to ship hundreds of doctors to the country. The doctors did not receive payments for their work, they alleged, and the Castro regime forced them to engage in espionage and communist agitation. PAHO signing onto the agreement prevented conservative lawmakers in Brazil from rejecting it and offered a shield to the Brazilian government should the United States take measures in response to Brazil enriching an enemy state. Thousands of Cubans began taking the streets of the island nations biggest cities on Sunday, flooding as many as 60 municipalities across the country with peaceful marches demanding an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. Authorities responded to the protests with violent repression that included reports of opening fire on crowds of protesters, beating them publicly, and, later, door-to-door raids shooting people in their homes and dragging them out to unknown locations. Protests reportedly continued into Wednesday, but Cuban government officials cut off access to social media, making it difficult for citizens to share videos and other images of the protests and corresponding repression. ""The agglomeration of people in protests over political, religious, cultural, or sports reasons increase the risk of transmission and especially if, as in the case of Cuba, there is active transmission in many places around the country,"" PAHOs emergencies director Ciro Ugarte scolded on Wednesday. Ugarte noted that in Matanzas province, east of Havana, doctors claim to have identified the Indian variant of the virus known as ""Delta,"" which is allegedly fueling an ""exponential"" rise in cases. Matanzas has experienced some of the largest protests and most violent police response. Ugartes tone differs from how the W.H.O. responded to the outburst of violent riots around the United States a year ago. ""WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds,"" W.H.O. chief Tedros said in June 2020. ""We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest."" Tedros statement occurred at a time when Cuba was still not experiencing any significant number of cases, but the Castro regime was nonetheless acting in ways that could facilitate the spread of the virus. The Cuban government began actively courting tourism in spring 2020 in response to much of the world locking down and restricting travel, hoping to take financial advantage of the diminution in competition for tourists. The first known cases of Chinese coronavirus in Cuba were documented in Italian tourists from Lombardy, at the time one of the regions with the highest rates of infection in the world. PAHOs discouragement of expressions against the Castro regime recalls its own questionable relationship with the communist government. In 2018, the Spanish online newspaper Diario de Cuba obtained government documents that revealed PAHO to be a party in the creation of Brazils ""Mais Medicos"" program, created by corrupt socialist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to import Cuban slave doctors and enrich the Castro regime. The documents showed that the Brazilian government agreed to pay salaries to the Cuban doctors - revealing the socialists claims that they were aware doctors would only receive meager academic ""stipends"" to be a lie - and that PAHOs involvement allowed Lula to go forward with the plan without consulting the Brazilian Congress, which may have opposed it given the large number of native Brazilian doctors the country counts on. President Jair Bolsonaro, who ended ""Mais Medicos,"" accused the Cuban government of using doctors to build espionage networks in countries that purchased them. Bolsonaro has offered political asylum to any Cuban doctor seeking to defect in recognition that the Cuban regime punishes defectors by banning them from coming home for at least eight years. A group of doctors who escaped the slave program sued PAHO in U.S. court following the revelation of those documents. In November, a U.S. federal court rejected PAHOs attempt to dismiss the lawsuit; it remains ongoing today. Experts estimate that the Castro regime makes about $11 billion a year selling slave doctors to allied countries.

138,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/americas/cuba-lifts-food-medicine-customs-restrictions-intl/index.html,"Havana (CNN) Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on travelers bringing food, medicines and hygiene products into the country in an apparent acknowledgment of demands from anti-government demonstrators . Thousands took to the streets across the island nation last weekend to protest chronic shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the government's handling of a worsening coronavirus outbreak, marking the most significant unrest in decades. The rare wave of demonstrations against the country's communist government has been fanned by a deepening economic crisis worsened by the pandemic. Covid-19 has devastated the country's tourism industry, sending Cuba's economy into a deep slump. People take part in an anti-government demonstration in Havana on July 11. Cubans now spend hours in long lines to buy food and medicine, and lockdowns have left many without work. Driven by desperate conditions, migration is on the rise by both land and sea. Since the start of the 2021 fiscal year, the US Coast Guard reported intercepting around 500 Cubans at sea. In a country known for repressing dissent, the demonstrations have been viewed as remarkable. US President Joe Biden on Monday expressed support for the Cuban people, urging Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel's regime to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement.

The US, Canada and the European Union have condemned the arrests of political activists and journalists, demanding their immediate release. ""The Cuban Government has attempted to silence their [Cubans] voices and communications through internet shutdowns, violence, and arbitrary detentions of dozens of protesters, journalists, activists, and other repressive tactics,"" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday, calling on the Cuban government to release anyone detained for peaceful protest. A line to buy food in Havana, on February 2, 2021. President Diaz-Canel blamed the unrest on vandals and criminals, and denied police had used excessive force against protesters. But, days later, he conceded that the government needed to do more to improve living conditions in poorer neighborhoods that had been rocked by the demonstrations. On Sunday, CNN journalists witnessed multiple people being forcibly arrested and thrown in the back of vans at protests in Havana. Videos of the protest showed demonstrators turning over a police car and throwing rocks at officers. The Cuban government has not said how many people were arrested or injured in the protests. Diaz-Canel said he didn't know the exact figure, but said ""tens of people"" had been injured. In San Antonio de los Banos, a city of about 46,000 people west of Havana, hundreds of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday, fed up after nearly a week of electricity cuts during the sweltering July heat. ""Everyone was in the streets,"" one resident, who did not want to be named, told CNN. ""They have gone six days with only 12 hours of power each day. That was one of the things that blew this up."" Anti-government protesters march in Havana on Sunday. On Wednesday evening, the Cuban government announced it would lift restrictions on food and medicine travelers could bring into the country -- a small concession for demonstrators. Custom duties on these products will not need to be paid, and the relaxed measures will stay in place for the rest of the year. The Cuban government blames its economic woes on the US trade sanctions, which restricts its access to imports and financing. In a recent nationally televised address, Diaz-Canel repeated that criticism and urged his supporters to physically confront protesters. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance on Sunday. ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets.""","['Patrick Oppmann', 'Eliza Mackintosh']",7/15/2021 12:43,Cuba lifts customs restrictions on food and medicine after biggest protests in decades,"['biggest', 'díazcanel', 'havana', 'streets', 'food', 'decades', 'restrictions', 'journalists', 'lifts', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'customs', 'economic', 'medicine', 'demonstrators']","Havana (CNN) Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on travelers bringing food, medicines and hygiene products into the country in an apparent acknowledgment of demands from anti-government demonstrators .

139,https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/blm-under-fire-for-defending-cuban-regime-blaming-protests-on-us/,"Black Lives Matter has been accused of hypocrisy by ignoring the pleas for help from Cubas oppressed citizens -- instead blaming the violent protests on US opposition to the Communist ""revolution."" The protest group -- founded by ""trained Marxists"" -- released a statement that completely ignored the mass calls demanding ""freedom"" from the oppressive Cuban regime as well as widespread reports of police brutality and arrests. Instead, it solely blamed the troubles on the US embargo, calling it a ""cruel and inhumane policy"" that was ""instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government."" ""The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" BLM said in the statement first given to a Politico reporter. ""United States leaders have tried to crush this revolution for decades,"" the radical left-wing group complained. The organizations statement was widely criticized online. NurPhoto via Getty Images While Cubans continue to risk their lives to demand the ouster of President Miguel Diaz-Canel, BLM widely praised his regime, even as the president himself admitted that his shortcomings were largely to blame for the revolt. ""Cuba has historically demonstrated solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent,"" the group wrote -- praising it for ""protecting black revolutionaries"" like Assata Shakur, the former Black Panther who fled prison in 1979 while serving life for the execution-style murder of a New Jersey state trooper. Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, remains one of the FBIs most wanted terrorists. She is rap icon Tupac Shakurs godmother. The BLM statement, shared by its official Twitter page, was quickly ripped online. Many Republicans have thrown their support behind the protesters seeking to end the oppressive dictatorship. AFP via Getty Images ""So wait, they support police brutality now?"" talk radio host Dan ODonnell asked, while another follower called it ""bizarre"" that a ""group founded to counter police brutality cant manage a word to criticize police brutality in Cuba."" ""@Blklivesmatter just sided with the oppressors,"" tweeted Canadian human rights lawyer Hillel C. Neuer. The hypocrisy was blatant, according to some lawmakers, with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) among those expressing outrage. ""The extortionist ring known as the Black Lives Matter organization took a break today from shaking down corporations for millions & buying themselves mansions to share their support for the Communist regime in #Cuba,"" Rubio tweeted. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel (center) walks alongside his supporters in the town of San Antonio de los Banos after anti-government protests. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Giancarlo Sopo, a communication strategist who once worked on President Donald Trumps re-election campaign, called the statement ""disgusting."" ""Despite the Cuban dictatorships murdering and beating of protestors (many of them Black), BLMs statement on Cuba...condemns the U.S., praises the Castro regime, and makes no mention of the atrocities being committed by the dictatorship,"" he tweeted. While the progressive left has largely been silent on the crisis, many Republicans have thrown their support behind the protesters seeking to end the oppressive dictatorship. Cubans continue to demand the ouster of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. AFP via Getty Images Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- the son of a Cuban immigrant -- insisted that the current regime will be ""consigned to the dustbin of history.""

140,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/15/cuban-american-protesters-take-to-streets-of-miami-lakes/,"Drivers honked their horns in support of the Cuban-Americans protesting Thursday morning at the intersection of Northwest 154th Street and Northwest 82nd Avenue in Miami Lakes as the protesters demanded freedom for the Cuban people. MIAMI LAKES, Fla. - Gov. Ron DeSantis made an appearance in South Florida Thursday, alongside other leaders from Miami-Dade County, to call on the Biden administration to help restore internet access to Cuba. ""The one thing communists fear the most is the truth,"" the governor said. Authorities in Cuba blocked social media sites earlier this week in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation. Restricting internet access has become a tried-and-true method of stifling dissent by authoritarian regimes around the world, alongside government-supported disinformation campaigns and propaganda. DeSantis said it wont be an overnight fix, but said the U.S. is capable of helping restore internet access on the island. #BREAKING: @POTUS is considering tech to help reinstate internet access in #Cuba. Adds hes not reinstating remittances bc he has no faith #Cuban government wont confiscate them. Would also be open to sending vaccines, using third party organization. @WPLGLocal10 #sosCuba -- Hatzel Vela (@HatzelVelaWPLG) July 15, 2021 REPLAY: Gov. Ron DeSantis, other leaders hold news conference in Miami amid Cuba protests Ad Earlier in the morning, drivers honked their horns in support of the Cuban-Americans who were protesting at the intersection of Northwest 154th Street and Northwest 82nd Avenue in Miami Lakes as the protesters demanded freedom for the Cuban people. ""Weve suffered for so long and we are here to represent our families and everyone who is still stuck in Cuba who has not been able to have at least the basic necessities of life,"" protest organizer Vanessa Wong said. DeSantis on Thursday praised protesters for remaining peaceful, but said blocking roads and highways, which happened Tuesday on the Palmetto Expressway, will not be tolerated. ""We cant have that,"" he said. But many say the governor is not backing up his words as the Florida Highway Patrol let the busy highway shut down on Tuesday, even though troopers blocked Black Lives Matter protesters from getting on I-95 last year. Ad No arrests were made in either incident. During Thursdays protest in Miami Lakes, no roadways were blocked by demonstrators. ""Its time that we seek a change and we ask for help from our representatives,"" Wong said. The rally comes a day after protesters in Miami marched for 5 miles in a demonstration of unity toward the civil unrest in Cuba. ""Whats going on on the island is really bad,"" one man said. ""If people go online and look for it, youre going to see (it) all. Theyre pulling kids out of houses, how theyre beating up people in the street for no reason."" Gov. Ron DeSantis says protesters in solidarity with Cuba should not block traffic, but praises law enforcement for not arresting anyone despite his own anti-riot bill. Demonstrators on Wednesday began their march at Cafe Versailles in Little Havana. They ended up downtown at the Freedom Tower, a landmark considered the ""Ellis Island of the South"" for its role in the 1960s and 1970s as the U.S. Cuban Assistance Center, which offered relief to refugees who sought political asylum from Fidel Castros regime. Ad ""This is the Freedom Tower, and it represents freedom,"" one man said. ""Most of the people, when they first came here, when the first exiles (came) in the 60s, this is where they came. This is where they came to get their paperwork and stuff done."" Activists say Cubans are tired of the communist-run government and want political change. Theyre dealing with shortages of food, medicine and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as power outages and internet connection problems amid a worsening economy. At the FTX Arena, theres an electronic sign that says ""Libertad,"" which means ""freedom,"" and #SOSCuba, which is the hashtag that protesters both here in South Florida and in Cuba have been using on Twitter in a desperate plea for humanitarian intervention. The Brickell Run Club will be hosting a three-mile run for Cuba at 7 p.m. Friday starting at the Bay of Pigs monument in Little Havana.","['Madeleine Wright', 'Amanda Batchelor']",7/15/2021 14:09,DeSantis calls on Biden to help restore internet access to Cuba as protesters continue to take to streets of South Florida,"['streets', 'south', 'lakes', 'desantis', 'access', 'florida', 'help', 'internet', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'freedom', 'continue', 'northwest', 'came', 'miami', 'restore', 'protesters']","MIAMI LAKES, Fla. - Gov.

The White House called communism a ""failed ideology"" Thursday, saying President Biden ""stands with"" the people of Cuba and their ""call for freedom."" Amid historic protests in the island country, White House press secretary Jen Psaki affirmed that the Biden administration supports Cuban protesters and their ""call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of repression and economic suffering to which theyve been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime."" BIDEN PRAISES CUBAN PROTESTERS AFTER CUBA PRESIDENT ACCUSES US OF FUNDING DEMONSTRATORS ""There is an ongoing review of our own policies, and as we look at those policies, one of the big factors is ensuring that we are not doing anything to pad the pockets of a corrupt, authoritarian regime,"" Psaki said, adding that the White House is looking closely at ways to ""help in a humanitarian way"" to ""support the voices of the Cuban people."" Psaki went on to call communism a ""failed ideology."" ""We certainly believe that it has failed the people of Cuba,"" Psaki said. ""They deserve freedom, they deserve a government that supports them - whether that is making sure they have health and medical supplies, access to vaccines, or whether they have economic opportunity and prosperity instead - this has been a government, an authoritarian, communist regime that has repressed its people and has failed the people of Cuba."" Psaki went on to note the ""ideology of the government, which has failed, and has led to a failure, a lack of access to economic opportunity, to medical supplies, to COVID vaccines"" are all reasons for the historic protests. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who days ago called on revolutionaries to counter anti-government protesters in the streets, acknowledged on Wednesday night government shortcomings in the lead-up to the unrest in the country. Diaz-Canel, who has been widely criticized for the countrys violent crackdown and internet blackouts, gave a televised address Wednesday night and acknowledged that his government failures played a role in the protests over food shortages and other problems. CUBAN PRESIDENT URGES COUNTRY'S 'REVOLUTIONARY CITIZENS TO COUNTER PROTESTS ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" Historic protests broke out across Cuba on Sunday night. Diaz-Canel, who heads the Communist Party, seemed uninterested in making any concessions. He placed the blame squarely on the U.S. for stoking resentment and called the protesters mercenaries. At one point, he said, ""The order to fight has been given--into the street, revolutionaries!"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cuba is facing its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. Some protesters have demanded a change in government, so although Diaz-Canel seemed to tone down the rhetoric, it remains to be seen if there will be any concessions by the government.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials pressed the White House on Thursday to support efforts to preserve internet service to antigovernment protesters in Cuba, even advocating the use of giant balloons as floating Wi-Fi hotspots to allow images of dissent to stream unabated from the authoritarian nation. Cuban authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the country after thousands of Cubans began taking to the streets last weekend to protest limited access to COVID-19 vaccines and basic goods. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in decades. ""We obviously have to stand with the people of Cuba against the communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said at a press conference in Miami, adding that restoring access to the internet is vital to supporting the people of Cuba. President Joe Biden responded later Thursday by denouncing communism and saying his administration is assessing whether it has the technology to maintain internet access for Cubans. ADVERTISEMENT Internet access was restored in Cuba earlier this week, but, as of Thursday, cellphone data was still not fully restored. The protests in the island nation have sparked an outpouring of support in Florida, which is home to the nations largest community of Cuban exiles. Throngs of people in Miami, Orlando and the Tampa area have rallied in support, sometimes shutting down major thoroughfares. DeSantis said every option should be explored, including using offshore and satellite technology to supply internet service. One option being considered is using balloons to provide connectivity. The Republican governor also suggested using the U.S. Embassy in Havana as a kind of hotspot. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth. And if were able to help Cubans communicate with one another -- also communicate to the outside world -- that truth is going to matter,"" DeSantis said. ""And so, Mr. President, nows the time to stand up and be counted."" Its unclear how the U.S. government or any other entity, public or private, might keep internet service uninterrupted. ""We need the political willingness from the Biden administration,"" said Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, whose parents were Cuban exiles. ""And if the federal government considers that they cannot pay for the resources, the Cuban American community will."" On Thursday evening, Biden denounced Cuba as a ""failed state"" that is ""repressing their citizens"" and called communism ""a universally failed system"" during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Biden said that the U.S. is considering ways to help Cubans -- as long as that aid is not undermined by the communist government. ADVERTISEMENT Biden said the administration wont ease a ban on remittances to Cubans because they believe ""it is highly likely the regime would confiscate"" them, and that while the U.S. is prepared to send ""significant amounts"" of a COVID-19 vaccine to the country, theyd have to be administered by an international organization in such a way that average citizens could get them. ""Theyve cut off access to the internet -- were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access,"" Biden said. Meanwhile, demonstrations in Florida continued for another day. Hundreds were gathering in Hialeah near Miami to show solidarity with Cubans. Earlier in the week, two Florida men were arrested during a protest in Tampa in support of the demonstrations and were held on charges related to the states new so-called anti-riot law. Julian Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 30, Maikel Vazquez-Pico, 39, were among those arrested Tuesday night as a group of protesters attempted to take over an exit ramp at Interstate 275 and Dale Mabry Highway, which is a major thoroughfare in Tampa. Both were arrested on charges that include battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting law enforcement and taking part in an unlawful assembly that blocked streets or sidewalks, records show. Rodriguez-Rodriguez put an officer into a bear hug as the officer was trying to arrest another protester, according to an arrest report. He then punched an officer in the face, breaking his glasses as the officer tried to arrest him, the report said. He continued to resist arrest until he was placed in handcuffs. The men were being held without bond in the Hillsborough County Jail early Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether either had an attorney who could comment. Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into law a Florida bill that boosts penalties against demonstrators who turn violent and creates new criminal penalties for those who organize demonstrations that get out of hand. Provisions of the law also make it a felony to block some roadways and give immunity to people who drive through protesters blocking a road. The bill was introduced after last summers protests for racial justice during which some Black Lives Matter protesters were met by police with tear gas and arrests when they took to the streets for days at a time. During his Thursday press conference, DeSantis again sought to differentiate recent protests over Cuba from those last year. ""Cuban Americans who are out demonstrating,"" he said, ""theyre not violent riots. Theyre out there being peaceful and theyre making their voices heard, and we support them."" But he said demonstrators should not be shutting down roads that could impede traffic and commerce. ___ Calvan reported from St. Petersburg, Florida. Frisaro reported from Fort Lauderdale.

143,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/15/gov-desantis-calls-president-biden-assist-providing-internet-access-people-cuba/,"Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on Wednesday urged President Joe Biden to step forward and assist in providing internet access to the people of Cuba, who have taken to the streets in protest of the oppressive, communist regime, prompting the dictatorship to shut down the internet to silence citizens. ""I write to urge you to assist in providing Internet access to the people of Cuba standing up against communist oppression and demanding a voice after decades of suffering under the yoke of a cruel dictatorship,"" the Florida governor wrote in the July 14 letter, detailing the demonstrations which have seen thousands protesting the brutal authoritarian regime: I urge President Biden to assist in providing internet access to the people of Cuba standing up against communist oppression and demanding a voice after decades of suffering under a cruel dictatorship.https://t.co/fjSKNxuchW pic.twitter.com/br4iPHZ4k1 -- Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) July 14, 2021 ""At first, the world could see the images and videos of this mass movement, but now the tyrannical regime of President Miguel Diaz-Canel has shut off access to the Internet,"" he said, explaining the Cuban people have lost their ability to communicate with each other. Many Floridians who were born in Cuba, he continued, ""have no information on the safety of their loved ones."" ""Equally as important, the world has also lost the ability to see what is happening on the ground as the Cuban people rise in support of freedom,"" he continued, urging the Biden administration to take action: Technology exists to provide Internet access into Cuba remotely, using the innovation of American enterprise and the diverse industries here. Similar to the American efforts to broadcast radio into the Soviet Union during the Cold War in Europe, the federal government has a history of supporting the dissemination of information into Cuba for the Cuban people through Radio & Television Marti, located in Miami. In addition to sending information, however, our efforts must include creating a means for the Cuban people to speak to the world. I urge you to act immediately to provide all necessary authorizations, indemnifications, and funding to American businesses with the capability to provide Internet access for the people of Cuba. Steps must be taken immediately. ""Internet access for the Cuban people is of critical importance as they stand up against the repressive Communist government,"" DeSantis continued. ""In the hands of these brave individuals, such access may be the key to finally bringing democracy to the island."" Indeed, Cubas state-run telecom monopoly ETECSA restricted access to key social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Telegram, this week as part of its effort to silence citizens: Confirmed: Social media and messaging platforms restricted in #Cuba from Monday on state-run internet provider ETECSA; real-time network data corroborate reports of internet disruptions amid widening anti-government protests; incident ongoing #CubaSOS https://t.co/7eGwPS1Mqf pic.twitter.com/kY3G1qMAse -- NetBlocks (@netblocks) July 12, 2021 ""The targeted restrictions are likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba following widespread protests on Sunday [July 11] as thousands rallied against the socialist government,"" the London-based internet monitor Neblocks surmised.",['Hannah Bleau'],7/15/2021 15:03,DeSantis to Biden: Assist in Providing Internet Access to the Cuban People,"['information', 'desantis', 'access', 'urge', 'biden', 'providing', 'cuban', 'internet', 'communist', 'world', 'cuba', 'provide', 'assist']","Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on Wednesday urged President Joe Biden to step forward and assist in providing internet access to the people of Cuba, who have taken to the streets in protest of the oppressive, communist regime, prompting the dictatorship to shut down the internet to silence citizens.

144,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-slam-marxist-black-lives-matter-for-blaming-u-s-for-cuban-unrest,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Republican lawmakers are slamming Black Lives Matter after the organization posted a statement that appeared to back Cubas communist government rather than the Cubans currently in the streets protesting. On Wednesday, Black Lives Matter released a statement condemning the United States for its embargo on Cuba and suggested its the reason for the current unrest in the streets. AOC, OMAR SILENT AFTER BLACK LIVES MATTER VOICES SUPPORT FOR CUBAN REGIME The statement angered several Republican lawmakers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, who accused Black Lives Matter of ""standing with"" communists. ""Shameful,"" Cruz tweeted . ""The group Black Lives Matter (funded by major players in corporate America) was founded by avowed Marxists and--as millions of Cubans risk their lives to rise up for freedom--BLM stands with...the communist dictatorship."" Cruzs colleague, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also took issue with the tweet and called it ""insane."" ""The radical Left has gone insane,"" Scott tweeted . ""BLM is blaming America for the cruelty and oppression of the Castro Regime and their views are being echoed by prominent socialist Democrats. Freedom-loving Americans stand with the people of Cuba, not with the Regime that is oppressing them."" Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida of Cuban descent, responded to the statement by accusing the organization of extortion. LARA TRUMP: AMERICANS SHOULD TAKE CUBA PROTESTS AS 'WARNING' ABOUT FREEDOM ""The extortionist ring known as the Black Lives Matter organization took a break today from shaking down corporations for millions & buying themselves mansions to share their support for the Communist regime in #Cuba,"" he posted on Instagram and Twitter . Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also took to social media to criticize the Black Lives Matter statement and said the organization is defending a murderous regime. ""It's no surprise that the Marxists of BLM are defending a murderous communist regime,"" Cotton said . CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thousands of Cuban protesters have taken to the streets over the last several days to protest the communist regime that has ruled the island nation for six decades, prompting violent crackdowns from the government that have killed at least one person . Republicans, including Rubio, have been critical of the Biden administrations response to the crisis and protests have developed in the United States calling on the Biden administration to do more on the issue. ""The U.S. stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights,"" President Biden said on Monday. ""And we call on the government of Cuba to refrain from violence in their attempt to silence the voices of the people of Cuba."" Republican Leader of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, R-Texas, commented on a tweet linking to BLM's defense of the Cuban regime saying, ""While black Cuban activists are beaten by the regime and languish in prison cells, Marxists shamefully ignore their calls for freedom.""",['Andrew Miller'],7/15/2021 15:40,GOP lawmakers slam 'Marxist' Black Lives Matter for statement blaming US for Cuban unrest,"['lives', 'slam', 'blaming', 'communist', 'cuban', 'unrest', 'lawmakers', 'black', 'marxist', 'regime', 'cuba', 'organization', 'gop', 'statement', 'matter', 'took']","Republican lawmakers are slamming Black Lives Matter after the organization posted a statement that appeared to back Cubas communist government rather than the Cubans currently in the streets protesting.

145,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/15/venezuelan-socialist-leader-cuba-protests-actually-euro-cup-celebrations/,"Diosdado Cabello, the head of Venezuelas ruling socialist party, stated during a press conference this week that the protests in Cuba do not exist and the footage of them widely broadcast throughout international media is, in reality, Italian fans celebrating the nations Euro Cup victory. Cabello is one of Venezuelas most powerful socialist leaders and widely believed to be the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a multinational cocaine trafficking syndicate. He also hosts a state television propaganda show, Con el Mazo Dando (""Hitting with the Mallet""). Cuban people began nationwide street protests on Sunday demanding an end to the communist regime. Thousands of people have taken the streets since, and reports indicate protests are ongoing as of Thursday in nearly every major city in the country. The Communist Party responded to the protests by issuing an ""order of combat"" demanding that loyalists violently attack anyone considered a dissident if seen on the street. As of Wednesday, thousands are believed to be in police custody or missing for participating in the protests. Despite the Castro regime openly acknowledging that protests are ongoing and blaming them on the United States, Cabello made the case during a press conference on Tuesday that no such assemblies had happened, calling the protests a ""media creation."" ""What happened on social media had nothing to do with reality,"" Cabello said. ""People [were] celebrating the Euro Cup and they put that photo out there as if it were happening in Cuba."" Cabello also claimed that some of the many images of Cubans protesting in clearly identifiable cities within Cuba were Argentines celebrating their victory in the Copa America, the South American equivalent of the Euro Cup. Both are soccer tournaments governed by the regional bodies overseen by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). ""It was in Argentina they were celebrating the America Cup, they took the photo from far away and, with no shame whatsoever, saying 'look at Cuba how it is,"" Cabello claimed: ""Era gente que estaba celebrando la Eurocopa"", se burlo Diosdado Cabello, numero 2 del entorno de Nicolas Maduro, quien expreso su apoyo al regimen cubano. #TodoEstaenLN. pic.twitter.com/QLqi33mPcR -- Diario La Nacion (@LaNacionPy) July 14, 2021 Cabello then repeated what has become the default far-left argument against the protests: the true cause of all suffering in Cuba is not 62 years of communist repression, but mild economic sanctions imposed on Cuba by the United States. ""They dont understand that its 60 years of a blockade for them to now think that five tweets from five influences are going to end the Cuban Revolution,"" Cabello said, offering the Venezuelan regimes ""solidarity, our support, our affection, our respect to the Cuban people and their government for the immense struggle they are undergoing."" Cabellos remarks joined a growing list of far-left South American socialists weighing in to defend the Castro regime. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the former president of Brazil, issued a statement on Twitter dismissing the protests as indistinguishable from protests against leaders in democratic societies. Lulas administration was closely tied to the Castro regime and invested heavily in Cubas slave doctor fundraising system. ""Is what is happening in Cuba so special to be talking so much about it?"" Lula asked on Twitter. ""There was a march. I even saw the president of Cuba at the march, talking to people."" Lula appeared to be referring to Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead president of the Castro regime, organizing a small government-mandated counterprotest on Sunday. ""Im tired of seeing protests against Lula, against [former Brazilian president] Dilma [Rousseff], against Trump ... people protest,"" Lula continued, adding that were it not for U.S. sanctions on Cuba, the country ""would be a Holland"" and that violence against black Cubans on the part of the police, unlike in America, was not happening. The same day Lula made these remarks, a video surfaced from Cardenas, Matanzas, Cuba, showing police beating and shooting a man in his home, in front of his twin two-year-olds, and dragging him away, leaving a pool of blood. The man was later identified as Daniel Cardenas, a black man who had marched peacefully on Sunday. While Latin American socialists - and American far-left groups - have banded behind the Castro regime, the administration of President Joe Biden has done little in response to the protests, urging the regime to listen to the protesters but failing to condemn communism for its role in creating the dire circumstances in which the vast majority of Cubans live. The Biden administration has repeatedly claimed that the protests are a response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested this week that Cuban protesters chanting ""freedom"" were actually calling for ""freedom from COVID [Chinese coronavirus],"" not freedom from communism. The Biden administration lifted sanctions on Venezuelas oil industry Monday, despite Venezuelas close economic ties to the Castro regime. The new rules allow ""all transactions and activities related to the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, of liquefied petroleum gas to Venezuela,"" giving a lifeline to the state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Sanctions on individual Venezuelan socialist regime leaders, including Diosdado Cabello, remain in vigor.

146,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-calls-biden-step-up-helping-restore-internet-cuba,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday called on President Joe Biden to help restore internet access to Cuba after it was shut down by the communist regime in an effort to clamp down on the spread of information amid protests that broke out on the island nation. Since Sunday, thousands of Cubans have taken to the streets to oppose the communist government that has had a stranglehold on power for the last six decades. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in decades. ""We obviously have to stand with the people of Cuba against the communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said at a Thursday press conference in Miami. The Republican governor said Biden needs to ""step up"" in helping to get internet back to the island nation. BLACK LIVES MATTER BLAMES US, PRAISES CUBAN REGIME, SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most, is the truth. And if were able to help Cubans communicate with one another, also communicate to the outside world, that truth is going to matter, that truth, I think, will be decisive,"" DeSantis said. ""And so, Mr. President, now's the time to stand up and be counted."" DeSantis said every option should be explored, including using offshore and satellite technology to supply internet service. Some of the options he suggested included using balloons to provide connectivity or using the U.S. Embassy in Havana as a kind of hotspot. In cities throughout Florida, home to the nation's largest community of Cuban exiles, demonstrations have broken out in support of the protesters. Earlier this week, DeSantis suggested that Florida-based companies should attempt to provide internet access to Cuba. He has also compared the situation to American efforts to broadcast radio into the Soviet Union during the Cold War in Europe. WHITE HOUSE CALLS COMMUNISM A 'FAILED IDEOLOGY AFTER HISTORIC CUBA PROTESTS It remains to be seen how the U.S. government or any other entity, public or private, might keep internet service uninterrupted. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden's administration did not have an immediate assessment of the proposals being floated by Florida officials.

""We're certainly looking at that to see what can be done to address (the issue), but in terms of that specific proposal I don't have an assessment of that.""

Diaz-Canels comments come as the Cuban government also made some concessions to allow more food and medicines to enter the country, NBC News reported Thursday. ""We also have to make a critical analysis of our own problems so we can act, so we can overcome and prevent from repeating themselves, so we can transform situations,"" the president said in a speech Wednesday. Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero also announced that as of Monday, Cuba will lift restrictions on the number of goods, primarily food and medical supplies, that can be brought into the country by foreign travelers, NBC said.

Thousands took to the streets Sunday amid food and COVID-19 vaccine shortages in the largest demonstration against the Communist regime in decades. The Cuban government, which continues to blame the US for inciting the protesters, cracked down on Monday, arresting dozens and revealing that at least one man was killed during clashes with security forces.

Cuba's government has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp amid the protests, according to global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks. read more ""They've cut off access to the internet.

At a news conference in Miami, DeSantis said the U.S. government should take action to boost Cubans' access to the internet and consider using the American embassy in Havana as a staging ground. Ideas suggested by some U.S. politicians include using satellite-based networks or high-altitude balloons to enable internet access in Cuba. ""Time is of the essence here. Every day that the regime has to black out the truth is a day they can get the upper hand on this,"" DeSantis said of the Cuban government.

REUTERS/Tom Brenner U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called on Biden ""to immediately authorize and allocate additional funding to provide internet to Cuba using the existing capacity of innovative American firms."" Menendez told MSNBC on Tuesday that ""we should be looking at how we can expand access to the internet, considering satellite feed of internet so that people in the island can communicate with each other."" Satellite-based services would require some physical infrastructure in Cuba, U.S. officials said. ""It isn't as easy of just moving a satellite and all of sudden it just goes straight to the devices,"" DeSantis said. Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, said on Thursday in Miami that ""this is not a technological problem. We have the technology today that can begin to be deployed to provide connectivity into the island."" In Havana, there have been regular and atypical mobile internet outages since Sunday, according to Reuters witnesses.

149,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/15/blm-trashed-supporting-communism-cuba-condemning-inhumane-treatment/,"The Black Lives Matter (BLM) organization defended police brutality by Cubas communist regime -- a regime estimated to have killed tens of thousands of its own people - in a social media post on Thursday responding to nationwide protests on the island. In the Thursday post, BLM blamed U.S. government sanctions and Americas alleged ""inhumane treatment"" of Cubans for crippling the country. Then, BLM asserted Cubans have chosen their own government and that support for pro-democracy dissidents inhibits their right to self-determination. ""This cruel and inhuman policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis,"" the post reads. (Emphasis added). In reality, communist dictator Fidel Castro took over the country in a violent siege in 1959, despite never having won an election. Fidel, his successor and brother Raul, and current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel have all not stood in any election since 1959, despite being the nations only leaders in those 62 years. BLM continued: The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination. Unites States leaders have tried to crush this Revolution for decades. Instead of international amity, respect, and goodwill, the U.S. government has only instigated suffering for the countrys 11 million people - of which 4 million are Black and Brown. (emphasis added). BLM further claimed the Cuban government has supported oppressed people and touted the governments protection of ""Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur,"" an American citizen named Joanne Chesimard who was convicted of killing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1977. Shakur escaped from prison in 1979 and received ""political"" asylum in Cuba in 1984, Breitbart News reported. BLMs post comes four days after protests began in Cuba on Sunday. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in more than 40 municipalities calling for the end of communism. Protesters were caught on camera yelling slogans like ""down with communism,"" ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" among other anti-government statements. Notably, protesters were seen cloaked in American flags, embracing the United States rather than condemning it for its alleged embargo. Even though BLM claims to be against police brutality, especially against black people, the organization did not mention the atrocities being documented on video throughout Cuba at the hands of police. Since protests began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten people in the streets, a large number of them Afro-Cubans. Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people since protests, Breitbart reported. Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued late Sunday. At the end of its post, BLM called for the end to the U.S. embargo on Cuba and alleged the U.S. has ""instigated suffering"" by ""cutting off food, medicine and supplies."" The U.S. embargo policy on Cuba does not prevent the shipment of food, medicine, or any humanitarian aid. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, ""Cubans import more than $2 billion in agricultural products annually, with $150 million of those sales coming from the U.S. Cuba also receives millions in foreign aid from the U.S. every year."" As far as travel goes, in 2019, nearly 500,000 people traveled from the US to Cuba, compared to more than 638,000 in 2018, CNN reported. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who is Cuban-American, has been very vocal about his support of the Cuban people -- especially in light of an unenthusiastic response from the U.S. federal government. Explaining the issue of trade with Cuba, he said of the embargo during a Tuesday speech on the Senate floor: You can open up all you want. We can pass a bill here that says, ""Open to Cuba. A hundred percent open."" Full free trade, you can do whatever you want. At the end of the day, the Cuban regime will control that opening. Its not just what we want to do, its what they want to do. ...They will use any opening as a tool -- as a weapon -- against their people, because thats what socialism does...Thats what these Marxists do in Cuba. They will use anything as a weapon against the people of Cuba. BLM was founded by leaders trained in Marxism, which is the philosophical underpinning of communism. Communism, which is the ruling political system in Cuba, has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people around the world over several decades. One of the groups founders, Opal Tometi, is also an open supporter of Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro. Maduro has presided over one of the worlds most repressive regimes since 2013 when his predecessor Hugo Chavez died. Under Maduro, Venezuelan police forces have committed a long list of human rights atrocities including the torture, kidnapping, rape, and killing of unarmed protesters. ""Tometi also served as an election observer in socialist Venezuela during the 2015 legislative elections. She praised the socialist dictatorship as 'a place where there is intelligent political discourse on Twitter during one of the bloodiest years of police brutality in the country,"" Breitbart News reported.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/15/2021 18:51,"BLM Openly Supports Communism in Cuba, Slams U.S. Embargo","['end', 'embargo', 'open', 'communism', 'slams', 'blm', 'regime', 'protests', 'cuba', 'post', 'cubans', 'million', 'openly', 'country', 'supports']","In the Thursday post, BLM blamed U.S. government sanctions and Americas alleged ""inhumane treatment"" of Cubans for crippling the country. Then, BLM asserted Cubans have chosen their own government and that support for pro-democracy dissidents inhibits their right to self-determination. BLM continued:The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in more than 40 municipalities calling for the end of communism.

151,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/15/lonergan-cuban-protests-reveal-bidens-border-hypocrisy/,"Six months into what has quickly become the most partisan, chaotic and dysfunctional presidency in modern American history, some undeniable truths are starting to emerge. One is that, while the Biden administration can depend on their fellow travelers in the U.S. media to spin domestic news to their benefit, they are helpless when international events occur that expose this White Houses duplicity and incompetence. This was on display last month during Kamala Harriss train wreck of a mission to Guatemala. She was greeted with protesters telling her to go home. The president of Guatemala called out the administration for worsening the border crisis, and Harris looked evasive and unserious when confronted with even softball questions by media allies. It is happening again as a result of recent events in the Caribbean. The president of Haiti was assassinated in his home, leading one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere into further instability. At the same time, citizens in Cuba rose up in perhaps the most public protests ever against the repressive, ossified communist regime that has been in power since 1959. It was a golden opportunity for an American president to support the Cuban people who are bravely standing up to tyranny. Instead we got the hapless, embattled Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas announcing that, while he supports the Cuban people, anyone from Cuba or Haiti attempting to sail the Straits of Florida to seek asylum in the U.S. would be sent back by the Coast Guard. The irony of the statement was thick, as Mayorkas emigrated from Cuba to the U.S. with his family in 1960. Since the passage of the Refugee Act in 1980, it has been American policy that anyone seeking asylum in the U.S. via the sea would be denied. This came after the Vietnamese boat people in the mid-1970s and those in the Mariel boatlift in 1980 overwhelmed U.S. port cities and immigration officials. The policy was enacted for legitimate reasons, but it raises a glaring question. If it is okay to protect South Florida coastal cities from being deluged with Cubans and Haitians, why has this administration abandoned such security concerns at our southern land border by allowing untold numbers of migrants to overwhelm communities from California to the Rio Grande Valley? Cubans who would sail to Florida will be sent back, but those who might venture to the Yucatan peninsula and walk across the border would be welcomed? The two policies are wildly inconsistent. A motive, as always seems to be the case with this administration, may be found in partisan politics. Bidens Democratic Party has fully embraced the idea that those fleeing the poverty of Central Americas Northern Triangle will make ideal Democrat voters in the near future. That explains why talking points from the left focus on the humanitarian obligation of America to allow entry to all those fleeing hardship in developing countries. Cuba, however, is a different case altogether. Since before JFK referred to it as ""that imprisoned island"" in his 1962 Cuban missile crisis address to the nation, Cubans have been living under the boot of the thuggish Castro regime and its current descendants. The regimes adherence to Soviet-style communism condemned generations of Cubans to grinding poverty, atrocious living conditions and denial of the most basic human rights. Most of those who managed to escape the island became staunch anti-communists who tended to vote Republican and have helped make Florida the right-leaning state it is today. Because of this, the left has largely acted as if the recent protests in Cuba never happened. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the self-appointed conscience of the Congress, devout socialist and advocate for oppressed people worldwide, said absolutely nothing about Cuba on her widely read Twitter account. Its bad enough that Cuban refugees tend to vote Republican. That they can speak with first-hand experience to the horrors of communism is apparently unforgiveable. Make no mistake, if there was a good chance that Cubans would make loyal Democrats, AOC, her ""Squad"" comrades and the Biden administration would advocate passionately how we have a moral obligation to rescind the Refugee Act right now and allow daily flotillas of Cubans into Miami. While our country is currently polarized along ideological lines, most people with a grounding in common sense could agree that we should have an immigration policy that is based not on fringe partisan politics, but simply what is in the best interests of America and its citizens first. If we are ever to break free of this administrations tone-deaf, hyper-political mismanagement, it will be required for those people to make their voices heard en masse.

President Biden said Thursday that he is considering establishing an internet source for the Cuban people after the government shut off access amid mass protests. An internet blackout was enforced by the communist state Sunday after Cubans hit the streets in historic protests over food shortages, inadequate access to the coronavirus vaccine, and unreliable electricity. ""Were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access,"" Biden during a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday. Biden also dismissed both communism and socialism in answer to a question. ""Communism is a failed system, a universally failed system, and I dont see socialism as a very useful substitute,"" the president said. ""Cuba is, unfortunately, a failed state and repressing their citizens,"" he continued. ""There are a number of things that we are considering doing to help the people of Cuba, but they would require...a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government."" DESANTIS CALLS ON FLORIDA COMPANIES TO PROVIDE INTERNET TO CUBA AFTER GOVERNMENT SHUTS IT DOWN The Cuban government ended the internet shutdown Wednesday, allowing videos and images to surface that revealed suppressive efforts by police forces to quell the protests, but service has been unreliable. The presidents comments come one day after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent a letter to Biden asking him to reinstate the internet for the Cuban people. Other top Florida officials including Lieutenant Gov. Jeanette Nunez, Republican Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar and Carlos Gimenez, and FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr joined DeSantis calls and held a joint press conference Thursday to plead with the president to take action. ""We are seeing on the island of Cuba people fighting against a communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said. ""A free Cuba is a noble cause. ""We have to stand with the people of Cuba against the communist dictatorship, and one of the most effective things we can do as a country is getting internet back on the island, but we need the Biden Administration to step up to make this happen,"" he added. WHITE HOUSE CALLS COMMUNISM A 'FAILED IDEOLOGY' AFTER HISTORIC CUBA PROTESTS Biden pointed to calls for reallowing remittance assistance to Cubans - a policy that was reversed under the Trump administration - but said he would not consider that option at this time. ""Because the fact is it is highly likely that the regime would confiscate those remittances,"" Biden said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He further outlined the possibility that the U.S. could send aid in the form of COVID vaccine distributions, as the virus remains a serious threat in Cuba. But he said he would only permit such an option if he was ""assured"" that an international organization would oversee the administration of the vaccines to ensure fair distribution among the population.",['Caitlin Mcfall'],7/15/2021 20:02,"Biden calls Cuba a 'failed' state, considers US tech option to send internet services","['state', 'desantis', 'considers', 'florida', 'send', 'biden', 'option', 'cuban', 'internet', 'considering', 'communist', 'cuba', 'failed', 'calls', 'tech', 'services']","President Biden said Thursday that he is considering establishing an internet source for the Cuban people after the government shut off access amid mass protests.

154,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-has-contingency-plans-if-it-faces-mass-migration-by-sea-cuba-official-2021-07-15/,"WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday the United States is prepared to send vaccines to Cuba if it is assured an international organization would administer them but he is not considering easing U.S. policy around sending remittances to the country. Thousands of Cubans on Sunday staged the biggest anti-government protests in decades to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Dozens of activists were detained. ""I'd be prepared to give significant amounts of vaccine, if in fact I was assured an international organization would administer those vaccines,"" Biden told reporters during a press conference after his meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register With regard to remittances, or payments Americans can make to their families in Cuba, Biden said he is not going to do that now. Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually and represent Cuba's third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism. ""It is highly likely that the regime would confiscate those remittances or a big chunk of it,"" he said, while calling Cuba a ""failed state"" that is ""repressing their citizens."" Biden also said the White House is reviewing whether the United States can help Cubans regain internet access after Cuba's government restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook (FB.O) and WhatsApp amid the protests. read more On a separate call on Thursday, a senior Biden administration official said the United States has contingency plans and a ""robust presence"" in the Florida Straits if it has to deal with any increased flow of migrants fleeing Cuba by sea. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, reiterated U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' admonition for Cuban migrants not to head for U.S. shores and said a senior Cuban official's threat of ""mass migration"" reflects ""a lack of care for the lives of Cubans who would risk their lives."" A vintage car passes by in front of the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, January 12, 2017. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The U.S. official said the protests ""will obviously have an impact on how we proceed"" with a review of Cuba policy that was launched soon after President Joe Biden took office in January. ""We saw that when we came in that the Cuban regime was actually cracking down much more on the population and that was having a bearing on how we were actually analyzing some of the possible policy responses,"" the official told reporters on a conference call. The official said the administration was looking at revising policy with an eye toward helping the Cuban people, not the government of the Communist-ruled island. But the official stopped short of providing specifics or a timeframe for finishing the review, which had raised hopes of re-engagement with Havana after former President Donald Trump rolled back much of the Obama-era detente between the old Cold War enemies. Before the protests, Biden's aides had been looking at a range of options, including easing the flow of remittances to Cuba and authorizing more family travel. Also under consideration has been whether to lift the designation of Cuba as a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" a label Trump gave to Havana days prior to leaving office. The official declined to say whether Cuba would be removed from the list but said Cuba's designation placed a ""statutory restriction"" on some of the other policy options. Asked about the prospects for mass migration from Cuba, the official said: ""We are actually urging people not to migrate."" Cuban migrants are largely flocking to the U.S.-Mexico land border, not the U.S. coast. And in a sharp break from his predecessor, Biden has been letting most in pending the outcome of their asylum applications, according to government data.

On Thursday, Black Lives Matter released a lengthy statement on the demonstrations in Cuba, condemning the ""U.S. federal governments inhumane treatment of Cubans"" and blaming U.S. sanctions for hurting the Cuban people rather than the authoritarian dictatorship, which has killed tens of thousands of its own people. That policy, BLM continued, has contributed to destabilization, ""undermining Cubans right to choose their own government,"" despite the fact that Cubans have not been allowed to choose their own government. ""Since 1962, the United States has forced pain and suffering on the people of Cuba by cutting off food, medicine, and supplies costing the tiny island nation an estimated $130 billion,"" the Marxist organization continued, failing to note that communist dictator Fidel Castro, who did not win an election, took over Cuba in 1959 in a ""violent siege,"" as Breitbart News detailed. ""The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" BLM continued. ""United States leaders have tried to crush this Revolution for decades. Instead of international amity, respect, and goodwill, the U.S. government has only instigated suffering for the countrys 11 million people - of which 4 million are Black and Brown,"" the organization added: Key GOP personalities expressed outrage following BLMs statement, particularly in light of the fact that BLM routinely condemned what it described as police brutality during the violent riots that overwhelmed several U.S. cities last year. Unmentioned in BLMs statement are the documented atrocities inflicted on the Cuban people by authorities: Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people since protests, Breitbart reported. Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued late Sunday. ""Heres the Black Lives Matter org supporting the brutal & oppressive dictatorship in #Cuba,"" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said following BLMs statement: Heres the Black Lives Matter org supporting the brutal & oppressive dictatorship in #Cuba - https://t.co/Y79yuTr2Mb -- Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) July 15, 2021 ""The extortionist ring known as the Black Lives Matter organization took a break today from shaking down corporations for millions & buying themselves mansions to share their support for the Communist regime in #Cuba,"" Sen.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) piled on, recognizing BLM as a Marxist organization. ""Biden cannot let his left-wing supporters pressure him into propping up Havanas communist regime,"" she warned: BLM is a radical Marxist organization.

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) expressed a similar line of thinking. ""A Marxist organization that not only supports defunding the police, but also supports an oppressive Communist regime,"" she noted, pointing to BLMs statement: A Marxist organization that not only supports defunding the police, but also supports an oppressive Communist regime https://t.co/QwBERIhTba -- Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) July 15, 2021 ""Shameful,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), the son of a Cuban immigrant, said.

156,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-blames-u-s-contribution-to-cuban-suffering-amid-historic-protests,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., broke her silence Thursday on anti-communism, pro-freedom protests that have broken out in Cuba by partially blaming the suffering of ""everyday people"" on the historical legacy of the U.S. 60-year-old embargo. ""We are seeing Cubans rise up and protest for their rights like never before. We stand in solidarity with them, and condemn the anti-democratic actions led by President Diaz-Canel,"" the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist said in a statement. She called the communist governments suppression of media, speech and protest ""gross violations of civil rights."" But she then evoked the United States ""contribution"" to what is turning out to be Cubas worst crisis in decades. ""We also must name the U.S. contribution to Cuban suffering: our sixty-year-old embargo,"" she said. WATTERS RIPS WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR UN TO PROBE US 'INJUSTICES: COMMUNIST CHINA, CUBA WILL 'CALL US RACIST Her comments came after Black Lives Matter issued a statement also blaming the U.S. embargo for the country's instability and credited the Cuban government for historically granting ""Black revolutionaries"" asylum. BLM called for the U.S. to lift the sanctions that are ""cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis."" Like Ocasio-Cortez, fellow Democrats have parroted Cubas communist governments own talking points, blaming the U.S., rather than the communist government for its plight. Many have called on President Joe Biden to end the decades-long embargo on the country. The U.S. imposed the embargo after Fidel Castro overthrew the U.S.-backed regime of Batista in 1959. Since then, presidential administrations have renewed the embargo, which is intended to isolate Cuba economically and diplomatically. BIDEN CALLS CUBA A 'FAILED STATE, CONSIDERS US TECH OPTION TO SEND INTERNET SERVICES Former President Barack Obama attempted to normalize relations with Cuba during his second term. Those policies were reversed under President Donald Trump, who imposed new sanctions. Last month, the United States voted against a U.N. resolution that overwhelmingly condemned the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba for the 29th year. Ocasio-Cortez called the embargo ""absurdly cruel,"" adding that ""like too many other U.S. policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I outright reject the Biden administrations defense of the embargo. It is never acceptable for us to use cruelty as a point of leverage against every day people,"" she wrote.

157,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/activists-lawyers-see-double-standard-florida-s-response-cuba-demonstrations-n1274120,"When demonstrators took to the streets of Florida this week to show solidarity with anti-government protesters in Cuba, shutting down a major stretch of an expressway and blocking streets in cities across the state, some eyes turned to Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis, a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, signed into law a measure that ramps up penalties against demonstrators this year -- including a provision that makes it a felony to jam some roadways during protests. HB 1, dubbed the ""anti-riot law"" by supporters, was introduced during last summer's protests for racial justice in the wake of the death of George Floyd, when some law enforcement officers arrested Black Lives Matter protesters or sprayed them with tear gas. But as protesters rallied in Miami, Tampa and Orlando this week, officers generally appeared to exercise restraint, reportedly making only a handful of arrests. In the eyes of David Winker, a defense lawyer who has represented Black Lives Matter demonstrators, the double standard was clear. ""I applaud the police for using discretion and not arresting everybody, but I want that same energy carried forward when the protesters have more melanin in their skin,"" Winker said, adding that he opposes HB 1 and supports the anti-government movement in Cuba. ""The double standard has been exposed because DeSantis specifically mentioned the issue of closing roads"" when he signed HB 1 in April, Winker said. Winker was referring to DeSantis' vow that there would be ""swift penalties"" for protesters who shut down traffic. ""You're driving home from work and all of a sudden you have people out there shutting down a highway,"" DeSantis said. ""We made sure that didn't happen in Florida. They start doing that, and there needs to be swift penalties. That's something that just cannot happen.""

Eva Marie Uzcategui / AFP - Getty Images The text of the law itself, formally known as the Combating Public Disorder Act, prohibits people from ""willfully obstructing the free, convenient, and normal use of any public street, highway, or road"" and makes violators subject to $15 traffic citations. The law includes other measures that have drawn criticism in Florida, including boosted penalties against demonstrators who turn violent and new criminal penalties for those who organize demonstrations that get out of hand. HB 1 also grants legal immunity to people who drive through protesters blocking roads. The American Civil Liberties Union has condemned HB 1. In a statement in April, Micah Kubic, the executive director of the organization's Florida chapter, excoriated what he said were the true motivations behind the law. ""Let's be clear: this is not an anti-riot bill, regardless of what supporters claim. It is a bill that criminalizes peaceful protest, and the impact HB1 will have on Floridians cannot be disputed. Each and every provision harkens back to Jim Crow,"" Kubic said.. The anti-government movement in Cuba, driven in part by fury over poor economic conditions, has in recent days riveted much of Florida, which is home to a large and vibrant Cuban population that traditionally sides with the Republican Party in presidential elections. The demonstrations over Cuba have not been entirely calm. Tampa police arrested three men involved in a demonstration at Al Lopez Park, two of whom were charged with battery on a law enforcement officer, according to a police statement. In remarks from Miami on Tuesday, DeSantis appeared to dismiss comparisons between the movement for Black lives and the demonstrations over the situation in Cuba. ""These are people that are rebelling against a communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said, adding that the demonstrations across Miami were ""fundamentally different than what we saw last summer."" But some Floridians linked with the Black Lives Matter movement say DeSantis' public rhetoric is an example of hypocrisy. ""When they protest for regime change, which aligns with the governor's political viewpoint ... you see no enforcement from law enforcement,"" Michael Sampson, who co-founded the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, told The Associated Press.

Adam DelGiudice / SOPA Images/Sipa USA via AP ""I think it's just downright hypocrisy we're seeing from the governor and even law enforcement in how they're applying this law. It goes to show how our fears that we had earlier ... that it will be used against Black people fighting for equal rights,"" Sampson said. DeSantis' spokeswoman, Christine Pushaw, commented in a tweet from her personal account Wednesday. ""The Left and aligned corporate media love authoritarianism. Therefore, they are FURIOUS that the Governor of Florida didn't personally drive 500 miles down the state to arrest people for protesting (not rioting) against the communist regime in Cuba,"" Pushaw tweeted. In an email, Pushaw said in part that DeSantis signed HB 1 to ""empower law enforcement in their own jurisdictions, giving local and state law enforcement agencies another tool in their toolbox to protect and serve the people of Florida."" ""The legislation protects First Amendment freedoms, while ensuring that law enforcement professionals are empowered to use their discretion to maintain public safety,"" she said. ""The Governor has always urged all Floridians exercising their right to protest, to make their voices heard peacefully and lawfully."" She said that blocking or obstructing roadways without a permit ""has long been illegal"" under Florida law and that law enforcement agencies across the state have ""discretion to enforce Florida law in a manner that ensures the safety of all motorists and pedestrians."" State Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat, told The Miami Herald that he believes HB 1 should be repealed. Jones, who is Black, told the newspaper that the possibility that the law was not being broadly enforced this week indicates that it was ""geared toward people who look like me."" The debate parallels the one that followed the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, when social justice activists questioned whether the law enforcement response would have been the same had the pro-Trump demonstrators predominantly been Black or brown people.","['Daniel Arkin Is A Reporter For Nbc News Who Focuses On Popular Culture', 'The Entertainment Industry', 'Particularly Film']",7/15/2021 21:49,"Activists, lawyers see 'double standard' in Florida's response to Cuba demonstrations","['penalties', 'lives', 'activists', 'lawyers', 'desantis', 'florida', 'standard', 'protesters', 'enforcement', 'double', 'cuba', 'law', 'hb', 'demonstrations', 'floridas', 'miami', 'response', 'black']","In the eyes of David Winker, a defense lawyer who has represented Black Lives Matter demonstrators, the double standard was clear.

158,https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/biden-facing-pressure-from-all-sides-to-respond-to-cuba-protests/,"President Biden is facing mounting political pressure to respond to the anti-government protests breaking out across Cuba, with Republicans urging the administration to take a stronger stance in support of the protesters, and some Democrats calling on the president to seize on the upheaval for a political opportunity. Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida -- both Cuban Americans -- have led the criticism against the Biden administrations handling of the growing unrest on the Caribbean island. C ruz  hit the Biden administration and White House press secretary Jen Psaki for saying Cubans are protesting the ""mismanagement"" by the government. ""The people protesting in the streets in Cuba are not protesting 'mismanagement.  I f you listen to what theyre chanting,  t heyre not chanting   manage better.   Theyre chanting   libertad.   Theyre chanting   freedom.    T heyre chanting down with the dictatorship ,"" Cruz said on Fox News. President Joe Biden is facing political pressure from both parties to respond to the anti-government protests breaking out across Cuba. REUTERS/Leah Millis ""But for whatever rea son  J oe Biden  and Kamala Harris are unwilling to speak plainly and to say the communist dictatorship in Cuba is evil ,"" he added.   During Thursdays White House press briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki declared that ""Communism was a failed ideology, and we certainly believe that it has failed the people of Cuba."" ""They deserve freedom,"" Psaki added before going on to say that Biden had ""made clear that he stands with the Cuban people and their call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of repression and economic suffering to which theyve been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the Cuban protesters are fed up with decades of ""socialist tyranny "" and deserve US support.  ""Theyve had enough of a regime thats stolen their dreams for decades, theyve had enough of its stranglehold on information and on prosperity, theyve had enough of its intimidation and its repression,""  McConnell said in a Senate floor speech on Thursday. He then accused Democrats of ""running interference for the Cuban regime."" People attend a pro-government rally in Havana, Cuba, July 11, 2021. EPA/Ernesto Mastrascusa ""  Some naive Americans on the left seem intent on once again running interference for the Cuban regime. They still buy the propaganda that Cuba is a socialist paradise, with a model health care and education system that we should actually emulate ,"" the Kentucky Republican said.    Rubio urged the Biden White House to take a more forceful approach to the situation and reach out to the United Nations and the Organization of American States, to get the international community to condemn and isolate Cubas government for its actions -- or face the consequences. ""A horrific bloodbath is what awaits if action is not taken,"" Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. ""So far the response has been weak, weak. Why?"" Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged the White House to take the lead on providing internet access to Cuba after the Havana regime shut down social media sites at the height of the protests. ""The Cuban people have lost their ability to communicate with one another, and many Floridians born in Cuba have no information on the safety of their loved ones,"" DeSantis wrote in a letter to the president Wednesday. ""Equally as important, the world has also lost the ability to see what is happening on the ground as the Cuban people rise in support of freedom."" At a news conference in Miami Thursday, the governor said every option to supply internet service should be explored, including using offshore and satellite technology and converting the US Embassy in Cuba to a kind of hotspot. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth. And if were able to help Cubans communicate with one another -- also communicate to the outside world -- that truth is going to matter. That truth, I think, will be decisive,"" DeSantis said. ""And so, Mr. President, nows the time to stand up and be counted."" At a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday afternoon, Biden said the administration was ""considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access."" But Democrats in Southern Florida are urging the president to take advantage of the protests in Cuba -- and boost his standing among Cuban-Americans, who supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. State Sen. Shevrin Jones said Joe Biden appearing with Cuban community leaders would help him dismiss criticism from Republicans. AP Photo/Steve Cannon ""I really believe this is one of those moments, I put it up with the moment of 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall because I do believe we can give the hope to the people in Cuba,"" Democratic state Sen. Annette Taddeo  said , referring to Reagans 1987 speech in front of the Berlin Wall. ""Its really about the people in Cuba who need to hear it. The words of the president of the U.S., be it Republican or Democrat, should matter ,"" said Taddeo, who  is considering challenging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 , according to the Miami Herald . The presidents presence in Southern Florida could be a game-changer, she said. Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, has helped lead the criticism against Bidens handling of the growing unrest. Stefani Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images Biden won the heavily Democratic Miami-Dade County by only 7 percentage points in 2020, but it fell far short of Hillary Clintons 29-point margin in 2016. ""Actions speak louder than words and again, to me, coming to Miami is an action in itself that is very strong,"" Taddeo said. ""Weve got a real crisis. We need to grab that opportunity, which is why I compare it to the moment of Mr. Gorbachev. "" State Sen. Shevrin Jones said Biden appearing with Cuban community leaders would help him dismiss criticism from Republicans, who, he said, often speak more forcefully about Cuba and Haiti. ""This is a prime opportunity for the president to engage with not only the Cuban leadership in South Florida but also the Haitian leadership in South Florida,"" said Jones,  the Miami Herald reported. ""Its clear theres a disconnect between Cuban-Americans and the Democrats,"" he said. Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo said, ""Actions speak louder than words.""

160,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/politics/cuba-communism-biden/index.html,"During a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Biden said that the United States is looking into ways to possibly reinstate access to the internet in Cuba but indicated that the US is not considering reestablishing US to Cuba remittances -- the practice of Americans transferring money to their Cuban relatives -- over concerns that the regime would confiscate the funds. ""Cuba is unfortunately a failed state and repressing their citizens. There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government,"" Biden said. ""For example, the ability to send remittances back to Cuba. We would not do that now because the fact is it's highly likely the regime would confiscate those remittances or big chunks of it.""

MIAMI - New videos from Cuba show special troops moving in and using force, and authorities shooting into the distance, likely dispersing crowds. On Cuban state-run TV, the Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel was somewhat apologetic to those who were accidentally hurt in the protests. He also admitted shortcomings in the way his government has handled country-wide shortages. It appears that the Cuban government is also feeling the pressure, announcing they will temporarily lift restrictions on food and medicine travelers can take into the island. History shows that anytime Cuba faces a major crisis, migration to the United States becomes an escape valve. That happened en masse in the early 1990s. Here in the United States, Cuba-born Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned Cubans against taking to the seas and risking their lives. Ad He says it will not work and they will be sent back. ""If they have a well-founded fear of persecution or torture, they are resettled in a third country,"" he said. In South Florida, the new boss of the Coast Guards 7th District shared a similar message. ""Anybody thats even thinking about taking to the sea, [think] twice about that,"" Rear Admiral Brendan McPherson said.

162,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/15/biden-cuba-a-failed-state-and-is-repressing-their-citizens,"And as Haiti decends into chaos after the assassination of its president, Biden says he is not sending US troops there. United States President Joe Biden, facing twin crises close to his countrys borders, on Thursday declared Cuba ""a failed state"" and said sending US forces into Haiti is not on his agenda at the moment. Protesters have been demonstrating in Cuba since Sunday as anger has grown about shortages of basic goods, electricity and internet outages, curbs on civil liberties and the governments handling of a surge in COVID-19 infections. The hardships are exacerbated by a decades-old US trade embargo that is being reviewed by Bidens administration. ""Cuba is, unfortunately, a failed state and repressing their citizens,"" Biden said Thursday at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House. Amid calls from Republicans and Bidens fellow Democrats to restore internet services to Cuba, Biden said his administration is looking into it. ""Theyve cut off access to the internet. Were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access,"" Biden said. Meanwhile, there have been calls for the US to send troops to Haiti after President Jovenel Moise was shot dead early on July 7 at his Port-au-Prince home by what Haitian authorities describe as a unit of assassins, including 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans. The assassination has pitched the already troubled Caribbean nation into chaos, coming amid a surge in gang violence that has displaced thousands and hampered economic activity in the poorest country in the Americas. Biden made it clear that the US is ""only sending American marines to our embassy"" for security purposes. ""The idea of sending American forces into Haiti is not on the agenda at this moment."" Biden-Merkel meet Biden welcomed Merkel to the White House Thursday to discuss disagreements about Russia and China as the two leaders seek to strengthen a relationship that suffered under former President Donald Trump. The US and Germany are key NATO allies. Biden and Merkel have known and worked with each other for years. But their two governments are at odds over a host of tough issues, including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, which Washington fears will hurt Ukraine and increase European reliance on Russian gas. They also disagree about the wisdom of partnering with China on business projects, restrictions on travel to the United States from Europe, and Germanys opposition to temporary patent waivers aimed at speeding up COVID-19 vaccine production. On the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, ""They didnt resolve their differences, specifically, the United States came into this meeting knowing this was going to be a friction point between the two leaders and it appears they didnt find any common ground,"" Al Jazeera White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett said. US President Joe Biden holds a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, July 15, 2021 [Tom Brenner/Reuters] Merkel told reporters that Germany, Europes biggest economy, has different views on the pipeline from the US. But she said Berlin viewed Ukraine as a transit country, evidently meaning she believed that natural gas should still flow through Ukraine, even if the pipeline is completed. Merkel said there are a ""number of instruments"" that Europe can take, including sanctions, if Russia does not meet commitments to Ukraine on the pipeline. Russia says the $11bn pipeline, led by state energy company Gazprom and its Western partners, will be completed later this year. Biden said that ""good friends can disagree"" on a project such as Nord Stream 2 and that both leaders have asked their teams to look at practical measures the countries can take on the pipeline if Ukraines energy security is weakened. Biden, 78, and Merkel, 66, see eye to eye on a string of broader issues, and both want to strengthen the transatlantic relationship that suffered under Trumps frequent, withering criticism of close US allies. Merkel, chancellor since 2005, plans to exit Germanys government after national elections in September, meaning she is likely to be seen as a ""lame duck"" in her final months in power. Polling shows her Christian Democrats are poised to take the lead in forming a government after the election, but it remains unclear which parties would be included in a coalition. Bidens Democratic Party has tenuous majorities in the US Congress that could evaporate in the 2022 congressional elections. Merkels White House visit - the first by a European leader since Biden took office in January - showed the US was trying to make amends with an ally that had often been attacked during the Trump years.",[],7/15/2021 22:37,Biden: Cuba 'a failed state' and is 'repressing their citizens',"['state', 'president', 'haiti', 'stream', 'white', 'merkel', 'biden', 'cuba', 'pipeline', 'house', 'citizens', 'failed', 'sending', 'repressing', 'ukraine']","And as Haiti decends into chaos after the assassination of its president, Biden says he is not sending US troops there.

The group on Wednesday put out a statement, not to condemn the authoritarian regime in Cuba for violently suppressing its people, but to berate the US for long-existing sanctions on the Communist state. ""Black Lives Matter condemns the U.S. federal governments inhumane treatment of Cubans, and urges it to immediately lift the economic embargo,"" BLM said. ""This cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis."" The statement is, of course, exactly backward. The US sanctions Cuba precisely because its Communist dictators prevent the Cuban people from ""the right to choose their own government."" Cubans gather outside Havanas Capitol during a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on July 11, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Videos posted on social media show Cubans young and old calling for ""liberty,"" and chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""Down with communism."" Theres a reason theyre not crying out things more like, ""We hate the America"" and ""U.S. sucks."" You would have to attend a BLM rally for that. The protesters are angry about a lack of food and medicine, but those shortages arent about US sanctions -- which allow humanitarian relief -- but the greed and corruption of the Cuban government. Yet BLM and the Squad dont want to admit that Cuba has failed -- because it shows that one-party rule, suppression of dissent, and a Marxist economy always lead to ruin. A man is arrested during a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on July 11, 2021. AFP via Getty Images It gets worse. Black Lives Matter then praised Cuba for hiding a cop-killer. ""Cuba has historically demonstrated solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent,"" the group wrote -- praising it for ""protecting black revolutionaries"" like Assata Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, the former Black Panther who fled prison in 1979 while serving life for the execution-style murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster. NJ State Trooper Werner Foerster and Joanne Chesimard AP; Reuters When will the corporations like Coca-Cola, Nike and Amazon that tweet ""black lives matter"" realize that the organization isnt dedicated to fighting racial injustice? Its a Marxist group that believes the United States is so racist that all of our society can only be fixed by tearing it down. Its against our free market, our institutions, and our democracy. It believes those who disagree should be censored and re-educated. It thinks all cops are evil, while cop-killers are heroes. BLM isnt about racism in America and it doesnt care about the Cuban governments oppression of its own people. BLM is about making us Cuba.

164,https://theconversation.com/cubas-mass-protests-are-driven-by-the-misery-of-covid-and-economic-sanctions-164505,"Cuba has recently riven by what the BBC has referred to as ""the biggest protests in decades"". What appear to be largely spontaneous outpourings of anger at the hardship faced by many people are being blamed on a severe downturn in the economy, which contracted by 11% last year and has continued to slump in 2021. The protests reflect popular frustration arising from worsening shortages, growing queues and recent power cuts. You can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa, here. Like other tourism-dependent economies, Cuba has suffered a severe shock as a result of the closure of borders due to COVID-19. In 2019 tourism accounted for 20% of all foreign exchange earnings, and the closure of borders in March 2020 resulted in a 75% fall in international arrivals for the year. But Cubas current economic difficulties do not arise only from the pandemic: they are also the result of US policy. Sanctions bite Thanks to US hostility, Cuba remains barred from access to emergency international financing from multilateral financial institutions (including the IMF, World Bank or Inter-American Development Bank) that are helping to cushion the blow for its Caribbean neighbours. The country is also suffering from a series of measures introduced during Donald Trumps administration to tighten US sanctions. Starting in 2017 and accelerating towards the end of his term, these had cut the number of international visitors and curtailed remittances flows. They also interrupted deliveries of oil imports, hampered (and added significant cost to) international trade and deterred foreign investment. Possibly the most damaging single measure, announced as a parting shot by Trump just ten days before he left office in January 2021, was the decision to return Cuba to the US State Departments list of ""state sponsors of terrorism"". At the time this received little attention. It was not heeded by US allies, such as Canada, the EU or the UK, which regard the US allegations as baseless, and continue their official engagement and fruitful collaboration with the Cuban government. But, for international businesses, including financial institutions, the inclusion of Cuba on the list set off warning lights in compliance departments, which bear responsibility for minimising the risk of falling foul of international sanctions. In line with the process of ""derisking"" that has intensified in recent years as the capacity of regulators to identify suspicious transactions has increased, most businesses have refused to engage in transactions involving Cuba. As a result, since January it has become increasingly difficult for any Cuban entities (including those sourcing medical supplies and food) to conduct trade, and almost impossible to arrange financing. COVID cripples In 2020, Cubas performance in terms of containing the spread of COVID-19 was exceptionally positive. But the economic contraction, disease-prevention measures and the diversion of government money towards this effort was already creating severe hardships, with lengthening queues for basic goods and rising prices. EPA-EFE/Ernesto Mastrascusa Then in January, Cuba experienced a second wave, with daily cases rising to an average of around 1,000 until June. And finally, they shot up alarmingly in July, to reach around 6,000. As of July 14, the cumulative death rate of 14.2 per 100,000 remains well below that of the US (now at at 182), but the daily number of deaths has reached 50. One of Cubas home-produced vaccines has proved over 90% effective in phase 3 trials and the vaccine rollout has begun to bring case numbers down in the capital, Havana, but the pace of production is held back by US sanctions and the spread of the virus at national level remains exponential. The combination of renewed COVID restrictions and diminishing resources have compounded peoples hardships. Also, the inflationary effect of a major currency reform, which aimed to eliminate the dual currency system, on January 1 2021, has added to a sense of insecurity. On top of all this have come power cuts caused by fuel shortages and technical problems. Hardship spreads The suffering has been particularly acute for those dependent on private sector activity. Between 2011 and 2017, around 1 million people - 15% of the working age population - had moved into the non-state sector, registered either as self-employed or as informal workers. State sector workers received substantial pay rises in 2020 and have continued to receive wages (albeit reduced) during the pandemic. But many of those working in the private sector, which had been mainly dependent on the spending of foreign visitors, saw their earnings dwindle as a result of tighter US sanctions and then disappear altogether because of the pandemic, leaving them with only minimal social security. The government has tried to protect the vulnerable and ensure that the basic needs of all Cubans are met, but its capacity to do so has been eroded. It has tried to control the prices of essential items, but growing shortages and rising prices in black markets have compounded the atmosphere of fear and desperation. At the same time, attempts by local authorities to respond to complaints about profiteers by suppressing black markets have brought conflicts. Resentments between Cubans have grown, and tempers are frayed. The protests in Cuba sprang from real economic suffering, and daily frustrations and resentments. Since July 11, the government has introduced new measures in an attempt to placate protesters and signalled a willingness to listen to complaints, although with its limited resources it can do little to ameliorate conditions in the short term. But the US government could do so, simply by reversing the Trump measures: a policy that was promised in the election campaign but has yet to be delivered.",['Emily Morris'],7/16/2021 0:00,Cuba's mass protests are driven by the misery of COVID and economic sanctions,"['sanctions', 'suffering', 'mass', 'driven', 'severe', 'rising', 'protests', 'covid', 'cuba', 'sector', 'result', 'measures', 'cubas', 'shortages', 'economic', 'misery', 'international']","Cuba has recently riven by what the BBC has referred to as ""the biggest protests in decades"".

BLM STATEMENT ON CUBA PROTESTS GETS SLAMMED BYRON DONALDS: Too many corporations, too many moderate, weak-kneed Republicans cower in the face of these radical Marxists. ... People like Senator Romney should be calling out BLM for not standing with the Cuban people. ... I want these people on that side of the political aisle to understand that if they wanted to actually be one of these groups in a country like Cuba or Iran or China, they wouldnt have the freedoms to speak against the countries that they actually live in. They would be arrested; they would be detained; they would be brutalized; they would be incarcerated; they would not be allowed to speak so freely like they are allowed to here in the United States. And so lets be very clear, they should be free to speak whatever they say--whatever they want to say, but if theyre about to put America on the same plane as to totalitarian, Communist Cuba government, then that means you have no idea of the true moral fight that is going on in Cuba.

166,https://nypost.com/2021/07/16/aoc-breaks-silence-on-cuba-protests-calls-for-end-to-cruel-embargo/,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on the US to lift what she called its ""absurdly cruel"" embargo of Cuba Thursday in her first formal statement responding to the ongoing protests that have rocked Havanas Communist regime. ""We are seeing Cubans rise up and protest for their rights like never before,"" Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) began. ""We stand in solidarity with them, and we condemn the anti-democratic actions led by [Cuban] President [Miguel] Diaz-Canel. The suppression of the media, speech and protest are all gross violations of civil rights."" The ""Squad"" member went on to call the embargo ""the US contribution to Cuban suffering,"" adding that it ""is absurdly cruel and, like too many other US policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point. I outright reject the Biden administrations defense of the embargo. It is never acceptable for us to use cruelty as a point of leverage against every day [sic] people."" Ocasio-Cortezs call to lift the embargo, which has been in place since 1962, echoed that of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who tweeted earlier this week that the embargo had ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" In addition, the Black Lives Matter group denounced the embargo Wednesday as a ""cruel and inhumane policy"" that was ""instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government."" People take part in a demonstration to support the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana. AFP via Getty Images One former Democratic member of Congress took issue with Ocasio-Cortezs statement. ""No. This is not correct,"" tweeted Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who represented Florida in the House for a single term before losing her re-election bid last year. ""Its the failed policies of a communist regime that has violated human rights, imprisoned & killed dissidents. Cuban ppl -young & old- are risking their lives to rise up, we must listen to them. A woman shouts during a pro-government rally in Havana, Cuba. Ernesto Mastrascusa/EPA-EFE/Shut ""This is a matter of national security,"" Mucarsel-Powell added. ""The US must act."" At a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Biden responded to a question about potentially lifting the embargo by saying: ""There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government."" The protests demanding the removal of Diaz-Canel and the end of the totalitarian system that has been in place since 1959 began Sunday and represent the most significant challenge to the Havana regime in nearly three decades. Diaz-Canel has blamed the US government and Cuban Americans for stoking the unrest and has called on his supporters to fight back in the streets. People shout slogans against the government during a protest in Havana. REUTERS The Cuban government has confirmed the death of a 36-year-old man named Diubis Laurencio Tejeda. Miami-based America TeVe reported that officials have claimed that Tejeda had a criminal record in order to ""tarnish his image."" The outlet also reported that thousands more are either missing or have been detained since the demonstrations began.",['Social Links For Samuel Chamberlain'],7/16/2021 4:50,"AOC breaks silence on Cuba protests, calls for end to 'cruel' embargo","['end', 'embargo', 'havana', 'president', 'called', 'protest', 'cruel', 'began', 'cuban', 'protests', 'aoc', 'cuba', 'calls', 'diazcanel', 'silence', 'breaks']","Rep.

Black Lives Matter's recent praise of Cuba's government isn't the first time that BLM has praised the country's communist regime. BLM previously glorified Cuban dictator Fidel Castro in an online post following his death in November 2016. AOC, OMAR SILENT AFTER BLACK LIVES MATTER VOICES SUPPORT FOR CUBAN REGIME ""We are feeling many things as we awaken to a world without Fidel Castro. There is an overwhelming sense of loss, complicated by fear and anxiety. Although no leader is without their flaws, we must push back against the rhetoric of the right and come to the defense of El Comandante,"" the post said. Castro's communist revolution included mass executions and imprisonment of political opponents. BLM's 2016 post outlined ""the lessons that we take from Fidel."" ""From Fidel, we know that revolution is sparked by an idea, by radical imaginings, which sometimes take root first among just a few dozen people coming together in the mountains."" In the post, BLM also expressed gratitude to Castro for harboring Assata Shakur, a convicted cop-killer who fled to Cuba after she escaped from prison in 1979. ""As a Black network committed to transformation, we are particularly grateful to Fidel for holding Mama Assata Shakur, who continues to inspire us."" ""As Fidel ascends to the realm of the ancestors, we summon his guidance, strength, and power as we recommit ourselves to the struggle for universal freedom,"" the post concluded. ""Fidel Vive!"" BLM currently faces a mounting backlash after releasing a statement late Wednesday that blamed the Cuban people's suffering on the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba and praised the regime. ""The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" the statement said. ""United States leaders have tried to crush this Revolution for decades."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Wednesday's statement, which came amid a violent crackdown on protesters, also credited Cuba's government for ""protecting Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur."" BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors has repeatedly praised Shakur in the past. BLM didn't return Fox News' request for comment by press time.",['Peter Hasson'],7/16/2021 5:43,Black Lives Matter glorified Cuban dictator Fidel Castro: 'Fidel Vive!',"['lives', 'revolution', 'fox', 'praised', 'dictator', 'cuban', 'fidel', 'castro', 'black', 'glorified', 'post', 'shakur', 'cuba', 'vive', 'statement', 'matter']","Black Lives Matter's recent praise of Cuba's government isn't the first time that BLM has praised the country's communist regime.

""I urge the Government to address the protesters grievances through dialogue, and to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to peaceful assembly and to freedom of opinion and expression,"" said Bachelet, a former Chilean president. She expressed concern over widespread arrests. ""It is particularly worrying that these include individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are unknown. All those detained for exercising their rights must be promptly released,"" she said. She also called for an end to sanctions against Cuba, ""given their negative impact on human rights, including the right to health.""

Police arrested dozens of protesters, sometimes violently, and the government has accused protesters of looting and vandalizing shops.

170,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/16/un-rights-chief-calls-on-cuba-to-release-protesters,"At least 100 people have been arrested and one person killed during rare demonstrations in the island nation. United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has called on Cuba to release protesters and several journalists arrested during days of rare demonstrations in the Caribbean nation, condemning the use of excessive use of force by security personnel. In a statement on Friday, five days after protesters first took to the streets amid unrest over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the governments handling COVID-19, Bachelet condemned the government response. One person has died and at least 100 people have reportedly been arrested since massive protests began on Sunday. ""It is particularly worrying that these include individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are unknown,"" Bachelet said in a statement. ""All those detained for exercising their rights must be promptly released."" Bachelet called for ""an independent, transparent, effective"" investigation into the death and for those responsible to be held to account. She also urged Cuban authorities to ensure internet access is fully restored after it was cut for several days earlier this week. Access to social media and messaging services have also been restricted during the protests. While Cuban leaders have said the unrest has been fomented - and funded - by the United States, which they accuse of using social media to exploit hardships caused by US sanctions, President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Wednesday for the first time acknowledged that government shortcomings have also played a role. He said the government must ""carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition"". Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced on Wednesday that the government would waive custom fees and size limits on food, medicine and other essential items for travellers entering the custom, in a minor apparent concession to protesters.",[],7/16/2021 10:33,UN rights chief calls on Cuba to release protesters,"['bachelet', 'rights', 'unrest', 'rare', 'cuba', 'arrested', 'social', 'calls', 'person', 'days', 'release', 'statement', 'protesters', 'chief']","At least 100 people have been arrested and one person killed during rare demonstrations in the island nation.

173,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/16/cuba-protesters-white-house-joe-biden-power-stop-this-one-day/,"A group of protesters urging American action to protect the lives of thousands of Cubans who began protesting peacefully against the regime this week across the island told Breitbart News on Thursday that the communist regime has launched a ""civil war"" and ""genocide"" against those seeking freedom. While Cuba has seen a growing number of peaceful assemblies against the ruling Castro regime in the past decade, the scale of the protests that began on Sunday - spanning over 60 municipalities from one tip of the island to the other - is a dramatic escalation from what the country has experienced in recent memory. The scale of the repression on the part of the regime has also grown. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead of the ruling Castro dynasty, issued an ""order of combat"" on Sunday demanding that civilian ""revolutionaries"" take the streets and violently assault anyone suspected of protesting against the regime. The regime shut down most access to the internet, but videos smuggled out of the country later this week show buses full of armed civilians driving into some of the cities with the largest presence of dissidents, apparently on orders to attack protesters. Members of the Cuban exile community organized a protest in front of the White House on Thursday both to demand that President Joe Biden act to save lives in the country and to raise awareness for the scope of the violence their brethren in the country are facing at the hands of their state. The protesters were adamant that reports in left-wing establishment media outlets attributing the protests to a rise in Chinese coronavirus cases were deliberately obscuring the true demands of those taking the streets. ""They are not asking for food - that they need it - they are not asking for medicine - that they need it, too - they are not even asking for medical attention, that they need it. They are asking for freedom,"" one woman at the event told Breitbart News. ""People in Cuba are tired of being repressed by the regime, the government. Its 62 years of repression, people going to jail just for saying 'freedom of speech,'"" another protester said. ""In Cuba there is no freedom of speech. ... They dont need food - well, they need it, but theyre not fighting for that."" Both protesters emphasized the many reports that the Castro regime is forcing civilians, including minors, to violently assault fellow citizens - and the fact that protesters cannot defend themselves because Cubans do not have the right to bear arms under the Communist Party. The attacks, the female protester said, are ""against people without any weapons because we have no weapons over there - its not like here where you can go and buy a gun or whatever you want."" ""Over there, theres no weapons. And these people are shooting our people, our mothers, our brothers, our children. Theyre killing kids,"" she lamented. The man accompanying her at the protest noted reports that the regime is sending police ""inside peoples homes and taking kids, underaged, and mak[ing] them go fight against their own people."" The protester demanded not military intervention by the Untied States, but a decree by President Biden that would allow Cubans in the United States to travel to the island and defend the protesters. ""Were going to do it. If you dont want to do it, no military intervention, were going to do it,"" he asserted. ""He [Biden] has the power to stop this in one day,"" the female protester said. ""We are asking for humanitarian intervention. If he doesnt want to do it or cant do it, at least let us go inside and help our people over there."" A third protester noted unconfirmed reports that some of the uniformed officers attacking protesters appeared to clearly possess accents that were not Cuban, potentially indicating the importing of Venezuelan troops to repress Cuban people. Late dictator Hugo Chavez and successor Nicolas Maduro orchestrated the colonization of the oil-rich country under the Castro regime; as of 2017, reports indicated that nearly 100,000 Cuban government agents were in Venezuela helping repress protesters and run the socialist regime. Maduro offered the Cuban regime ""all the support"" possible in public remarks on Monday. ""We are here because we know America doesnt really know what is going on with our people,"" one of the protesters explained. ""America needs to know that 90 miles from the United States, there is a genocide ... this administration has the power to stop a genocide right now and they are not doing nothing [sic], just talking and talking."" ""Theyre pulling the teenagers and bringing them to the street to fight people that are still on the street,"" she explained. ""Its not two or three against them - its like maybe ten people inside your house getting your husband and killing him in front of your children ... this is a genocide."" The protesters repeatedly referenced a video surfacing from Cardenas, northwestern Cuba, this week of a home invasion by Cuban ""black berets,"" or police special forces. The video appears to show an officer break into the home with an attack dog and shoot a man in his living room, in front of his wife - who can be heard screaming in the video - and their twin two-year-old sons. Reporters later identified the man as Daniel Cardenas Diaz. His wife, Marbely Vasquez, told Miamis El Nuevo Herald that her husband marched peacefully on Sunday, which apparently prompted a mob of plain-clothed police and armed civilians to beat him in his own home, causing most of the large pool of blood seen in the video. The officer then came in and shot him, taking him away to a police station. Cardenas health status is unknown at press time.",['Frances Martel'],7/16/2021 14:09,Cuba Protesters at White House: Joe Biden 'Has the Power to Stop This in One Day',"['stop', 'reports', 'video', 'need', 'power', 'white', 'biden', 'protester', 'cuban', 'regime', 'cuba', 'house', 'asking', 'day', 'country', 'going', 'joe', 'protesters']","""People in Cuba are tired of being repressed by the regime, the government.

Hialeah has the greatest concentration of Cuban exiles in the U.S. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) MIAMI (AP) -- Federal authorities are warning organizers planning to launch a flotilla next week from South Florida to waters near Cuba that they could risk breaking the law. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in an advisory Thursday that boaters intending to enter Cuban territorial waters must get permission from the U.S. Coast Guard. Violators risk facing fines of $25,000 a day and 10 years in prison, the advisory said. ""It is illegal for boaters to depart with the intent to travel to Cuba for any purpose without a permit,"" the advisory said. People who bring foreign nationals into the U.S. illegally risk facing fines of up to $250,000 a day and five years in prison, the department said. According to Osdany Veloz, an organizer of the boaters, the goal of next Mondays planned trip is to go to international waters near the island, but not cross into Cuban waters, to let island residents know they have supporters in South Florida. ADVERTISEMENT Organizers said they will set sail from South Florida if 100 boaters show up, according to Miami television station WFOR-TV. ""The purpose is to stay on the border, not trespassing, stay in international water and just let the Cuban people know were also fighting for their freedom, so once and for all they can be a free country,"" said Jorge Lopez, who plans to make the trip. Thousands of Cubans began taking to the streets last weekend to protest limited access to COVID-19 vaccines and basic goods. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in decades. The protests in the island nation have sparked an outpouring of support in Florida , which is home to the nations largest community of Cuban exiles. Throngs of people in Miami, Orlando and the Tampa area have rallied in support, sometimes shutting down major thoroughfares.",['Associated Press'],7/16/2021 17:22,"Florida boaters could risk fines, prison by going to Cuba","['fines', 'south', 'florida', 'hialeah', 'cuban', 'boaters', 'waters', 'ap', 'cuba', 'island', 'prison', 'exiles', 'risk', 'going']","Violators risk facing fines of $25,000 a day and 10 years in prison, the advisory said.

175,https://havanatimes.org/diaries/osmelramirez/heavy-state-security-presence-arrests-in-mayari-cuba/,"The July 11th protests and the aftermath in my city in Holguin, Cuba By Osmel Ramirez Photo: cubadebate.cu HAVANA TIMES - People had no time to react or think about repression or subsequent reprisals of power that crushes the individual detained with no rights. The desperation is so great; the shortages, the obstacles and the penalties are so many. Plus, the quarantines, hunger, and no medicines is so hard to live with; that they had to lose their fear and go out to protest. It started in San Antonio de los Banos on the outskirts of Havana and spread all over Cuba. It took me a while to believe it. Could they be running to catch some sort of transport? They asked over the phone from one Cuban to another. But little by little it became credible because it was gigantic. A special program on the official television with the despicable Humberto Lopez ended up in convincing those manipulated by official propaganda and without internet. They believe the story that on social networks everything is fake news. So, just like everywhere else, people from Mayari started to organize going out on the streets using a local Facebook Buy and Sell page. Some were enthusiastic to go, according to the comments, the same happened in the larger city of Holguin and other municipalities. Some young people and business owners arrived shouting 'Patria y Vida (Homeland and Life), and 'It has already started, go out to the street. In the Cocal neighbourhood a group was getting ready to march through the towns main street to the center. A business owner named Julio Antonio Lopez Rodriguez (alias Koqui), set out on his moped with another person behind and moved through the main streets of the city encouraging people to come out shouting 'Patria y Vida. Then torrential rain started and lasted several hours until nightfall of this now historic July 11th, and the momentum was lost. By the time the rain stopped the streets had been taken over by a Ministry of Interior (MININT) presence. Likewise, the army activated command posts of military defense and they began to recruit the reserves. The word on the street is that the country is in 'phase 1 activating and mobilizing the Defence Councils. To prevent the spread of a national protest among people and looting of shops and warehouses, they mobilized all the administrators of state retail businesses and food service units, along with political agents and community officials to protect these state properties. The main potential targets that were highly militarized were the shops that sell in US dollars. For months they have been the object of popular rejection because they sell only in a foreign currency. They were the target of assaults by angry crowds in various parts of the country. Since Sunday, police cars and motorbikes with officers patrol the streets of the city constantly, as if there was no shortage of petrol. Internet was suspended here since Sunday night and it became more dangerous to walk in groups. ""The objective is that people remain disconnected and hearing only the official message,"" said Confesor Verdecia, a local human rights activist. ""The strategy is always the same, highlight the protests as an act of mercenaries instigated by the 'empire (EUA) and not a legitimate popular reaction"". ""I have contacts with thousands of people in the opposition inside and outside of Cuba, and no one told me of any special organization for yesterday, Sunday. It was the same as usual on the social networks, but there was no sign of anything coordinated. This was something spontaneous and the truth is, that is the only way things work in Cuba. Anything organized fails because the State Security neutralizes it immediately. ""I went to the street like others to show up and join in, but very quickly the rain started and the internet didnt work. Even though there was no protest here what happened Sunday was incredible. I still find it hard to believe that people have been that courageous. This country is waking up and now I believe that yes, we can have hope that this is going to change and that one day we will have democracy and freedom. I am hopeful, if this continues we have to be part of it"". The lack of communication makes it impossible to know all of the incidents and the details. In this municipality in the Guaro area, a small town ten kms from the main municipality, an opponent Teresa Miranda Cespedes began banging saucepans at 9 oclock at night in support of the protests all over the country and this was counteracted by a hate rally on the part of local official agents. ""Everything seems to indicate that they were ready for whatever I would do, they stopped me. Vulgar and offensive people, the same as the neighbourhood defence committee (CDR). One of the women wanted to attack me and I had to defend myself with stones to make her back off,"" Miranda Cespedes told Diario de Cuba. On Monday morning, July 12th, Koqui, the business owner who did the rounds of the city encouraging people to come out on the street shouting 'Patria y Vida, was detained in a dramatic operation by MININT and is still imprisoned and in isolation. Neighbours and family members confirmed that if he is not released quickly, they will go back out on the streets to demand his freedom.

176,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2021/07/16/cubans-used-homemade-radios-to-avoid-the-internet-shutdown-now-they-are-being-jammed-too/,"Communist Cuba has engaged in a massive campaign of radio jamming this week in response to protesting Cuban citizens taking to the airwaves - often with homemade radios - to get news in and out of the country after the regime turned off the internet. Cubas state-run telecommunications firm severely constricted the access of ordinary citizens to swathes of the internet in recent days, with social media and messaging apps all impacted. As Breitbart News reported this week, the anti-information move comes amid a rising tide of anti-government protests on the island, which are being violently repressed by the regime. Resourceful Cubans were able to sidestep the governments attempt to crack down on the flow of information on and off the island, however, by using Cubas proximity to Florida and the availability of hobbyist amateur radio operators to keep talking. Relatively simple, low-power, homemade radios allow voice communication on common civilian frequencies between Cuba and the Southern United States now, as it did decades ago in the pre-internet age. The Cuban government soon got wise to this, however, and rapidly started using extremely high-power jamming equipment to render the useful parts of the radio spectrum unusable. At the time of publication, that jamming was still ongoing, Floridian radio amateurs said. ""Dont believe the good things they say about communism. Its not real,"" said Adrian Arteaga, who escaped Cuba when he was 18. https://t.co/wdyWMlyxfX -- Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) July 15, 2021 Cuban exile and licensed U.S. amateur radio station operator Alex Valladares spoke to Breitbart London from Florida and explained how, after the internet went down in Cuba, he felt he had a duty to let Cubans know they werent alone and to help convey information in and out of the country. Valladares said: ""if they are protesting in Cuba and Im a free man, I think the best thing that I could do is pass them the welfare information, the emergency communication. They dont have the internet now, the government dont want them to know the truth, they dont want them to know they are organised, that they are all out on the streets."" He said he started talking to Cubans on shortwave on the frequencies he knew most Cubans would be able to receive and transmit on, with the rudimentary equipment they had. But he soon found the frequency he was using became completely flooded with high-power noise, so Valladares switched to a new one, and the same soon followed. In fact, he said, wherever Cubans were trying to talk to exiles in Florida on amateur radio, massive jamming knocking stations off the air quickly followed. ""[The interference] is following me and following the Cuban people when they have their daily nets. They dont want the people to communicate in Cuba, thats why they cut off the internet and all sorts of media is blocked ... They tried to block any signal there because they dont want the Cuban people - many who have homemade radios - they dont want them to listen to the exiles in Miami like me, and many others around Florida delivering the world to them,"" Valladares said. This was possible, he said, because the Cuban government has a large amount of decades-old jamming equipment dating back to the Cold War, when the regime would try to block broadcasts of U.S. government anti-Communist stations like Radio Marti from reaching Cuban ears. Valladares is now concerned for the wellbeing of radio operators on the island, given the degree to which speaking to the outside world is an act of defiance to a murderous regime. While he encourages his listeners not to reply vocally to his messages and to make non-verbal sounds instead to let him know they are out there while avoiding identification, it remains the case private radio operation in Cuba requires a government license, meaning the regime has a list of radio owners and their addresses. ""I always look for the best empty frequency, and I talk at 1.2kw, I know they are listening to me because I have had feedback from Cuba and they say they are listening to me,"" Valladares explained. ""There are a couple of Cubans I talked to on Sunday and Monday, but I couldnt talk to them yesterday and Im a little bit concerned about their lives, maybe the government went for them, you know?"" ""They are going after these protesters, they are looking at the [viral protest] videos and they are going after them, to their houses, they take them out at night, and they kill them. With no justification,"" he added. As Breitbart has reported this week, the Communist regime has indeed been absolutely brutal in its repression of protests, including firing into crowds, public beatings, and visiting suspected protesters at their homes and shooting them in front of their families. As for what comes next, Valladares said he would keep broadcasting and trying to find a way around the jamming. He said that, while he recognized many Americans would normally be rightly against the government getting involved in a foreign civil war, such a thing generally involves two armed sides fighting, which he said wasnt representative of the situation in Cuba. With the population totally disarmed, the protests were characterized by citizens with stones against soldiers with guns, he said, and the Cuban people needed help. He called for aid from the United States and NATO, saying: ""The government of Cuba is massacring the people who do not have weapons. Nobody in Cuba has weapons. Fidel Castro took the weapons in 1961. Anyone with a weapon has been put in jail."" ""In Cuba, the only people who have weapons are the government and they are massacring the people, and that has to be stopped ... SOS Cuba, Freedom to Cuba. The Cuban people need freedom,"" Valladares told Breitbart News. Breitbart approached the Federal Communications Commission, Radio Marti, and the American Radio Relay League for comment on the massive interference on the 40-meter band presently being experienced in the vicinity of Cuba but they all had failed, at the time of publication, to respond. Thousands of Cubans in at least 16 cities took the streets peacefully on Sunday to demand an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. https://t.co/ZX9C1gOj9v -- Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) July 12, 2021",['Oliver Jj Lane'],7/16/2021 17:52,"Cubans Turn to Homemade Radio After Web Blocked, Govt Jams Signals","['radio', 'jamming', 'valladares', 'web', 'cuban', 'turn', 'signals', 'homemade', 'govt', 'blocked', 'cubans', 'cuba', 'regime', 'dont', 'breitbart', 'know', 'jams']","The Cuban government soon got wise to this, however, and rapidly started using extremely high-power jamming equipment to render the useful parts of the radio spectrum unusable.

177,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fake-news-muddies-online-waters-during-cuba-protests-2021-07-16/,"HAVANA, July 16 (Reuters) - False news reports spread fast following unprecedented protests in Cuba last Sunday, among them: Raul Castro had fled to ally Venezuela, protesters had kidnapped a provincial Communist Party chief, and Caracas was sending in troops. The Cuban government said they were spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics of the government said they may have come from the authorities themselves. Neither provided evidence for their claims and Reuters was unable to ascertain the origins of the stories. The Cuban government said the stories, which spread on social media and messaging apps, were part of a broader U.S.-backed attempt by counter-revolutionaries to destabilize the country. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""What calumnies, what lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel late on Wednesday, exposing some of the fake news stories on a televised roundtable. ""The way they are using social media is poisonous and alienating."" ""It is an expression of media terrorism,"" he said. Government critics said authorities could be planting the stories to muddy online waters with misinformation and sow confusion so that no-one trusts future news of unrest. ""Often it is state security launching these kind of rumors to afterwards... say they are foreign-directed campaigns to manipulate Cubans so people stop trusting in information circulating outside government control,"" wrote Mexican-based communications specialist Jose Raul Gallego on Facebook. Both the government and some of its most prominent critics urged Cubans to take care not to share non-verified information. Some of the stories were amplified by Cubans abroad cheering on the protests. The proliferation of manufactured or misleading videos and content on social media has become a common feature of social protests around the world in recent years, including in Chile, Bolivia, the United States and France. Thousands took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilized. Early reports of protests on Sunday were also followed swiftly by internet outages and restrictions on social media and messaging platforms. Service was slowly returning to normal by Friday. SOCIAL MEDIA - TOOL OR BURDEN? The introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago and the subsequent flourishing of social media and independent news outlets in Cuba has been a key factor behind the protests. These tools have given Cubans a platform to share and amplify their frustrations and enabled the word to get out quickly when people are on the street, analysts say. Many Cubans learned of Sunday's protests on messaging applications like WhatsApp or on Facebook. But Cuba's government, which has long had a monopoly on mass media, warned citizens against believing news and images shared on social media that may have been manipulated. Posts shared thousands of times in recent days were mislabeled as Cuban protests. Some included photos that showed a large crowd during Cuba's 2018 May Day march or a protest in Egypt in 2011. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez accused social media platforms of generally only launching investigations into suspected fake news when it hurt the ""powerful."" ""It's known which monopolies operate in the digital space... how they work, in which countries they are headquarters... and how much politics goes on,"" he told a news briefing on Tuesday. Twitter, which has not reported taking down any coordinated attempts to influence events around the Cuba protests with misinformation, said in a statement: ""Investigations are ongoing. We'll continue to monitor the situation and remain vigilant."" Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reinaldo Escobar, editor of independent news site 14ymedio, said that regardless of who published the fake news and with what motivation, many Cubans now had the direct experience of participating in or observing genuine spontaneous demonstrations. ""This massive coming out of the closet of fear will have consequences,"" he said.

REUTERS/Kevin Fogarty July 16 (Reuters) - ""Cuba Libre"" was painted in giant block letters on the street directly in front of the Cuban embassy in Washington on Friday following unprecedented protests on the Communist-led island last weekend. The phrase - which literally means 'free Cuba' - has long been associated with both Cuban independence from Spain and later its 1959 revolution. It was not immediately clear who was behind the giant lettering, whose format echoed the yellow 'Black Lives Matter' mural that was painted on a street near the White House in 2020 during U.S. protests against racism and police brutality. That section of street was later renamed officially 'Black Lives Matter Plaza.'

In the United States, and especially in Florida which has a large community of Cuban exiles, demonstrators also staged protests, waving Cuban flags and calling for change. In the wake of the protests, U.S. President Joe Biden called Cuba a ""failed state"" that is ""repressing their citizens,"" dashing hopes he could lift crippling sanctions any time soon that have contributed to the country's worst economic crisis in decades.

179,https://havanatimes.org/features/the-internet-blackout-that-followed-protests-in-cuba/,"Photo: Ernesto Verdecia By Jorge Carlos de la Paz (El Toque) HAVANA TIMES - When the massive protests broke out on Sunday, July 11, the Government decided without warning to restrict access to social media and other internet services. Reports began to come in from Cubans about the missing services. Additionally, the restrictions were confirmed by a report from the internet monitor, NetBlocks. After more than 48 hours without internet, various Cubans on the island reported a gradual reestablishment of access to the network. Data from Internet NetBlocks confirmed the partial interruption of social media and messaging networks from July 12th. WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and some servers of Telegram were blocked by the Cuban Telecommunications Company (Etecsa). ""The NetBlocks internet performance metrics at 50 points of observation from July 12th, 2021 confirmed that the front end and back end servers of the listed online platforms have stopped being partially or totally available to landlines and cell phones in Cuba, which corroborates reports from users,"" the company reported. During this lapse, Cubans were unable to communicate using these networks both inside and outside the country. Likewise, online consumer services were blocked and, of course, access to groups buying and selling food, medicine, and other products in messaging and other social media platforms. Sunday, July 11, thousands of people came into the streets across the country in an unprecedented demonstration inside Cuba. They demanded freedom, change, vaccination, and, generally, solutions to the current crisis in the nation. The government reacted with a confrontational attitude arguing that the demonstrations were only ""acts of public disorder and vandalism"" encouraged from outside the country. After convoking ""the revolutionaries"" to take over the streets and confront the protestors,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel declared ""the people"" were reacting spontaneously. ""defending their reasons and their truths, and we have many comrades who have been injured, many of these people were beaten and stoned by all these delinquents."" There are reports and evidence of known groups of para-police dressed as civilians passing for ""the people"" acting under the passive gaze of the uniformed forces of order with whom they collaborate. The Cuban government pointed to external enemies as the only cause of what it called ""disturbances"" and blamed social media for having incited Sundays actions. Tuesday, July 13, the Minister of Foreign Relations, Bruno Rodriguez, was asked twice at a press conference by foreign journalists about the restriction of data in Cuba. ""In the face of attacks, of course we will respond with measures in an appropriate manner and always based on consensus,"" he said, alluding to difficulties in the network and computer nodes as being cause by ""the difficult economic situation."" Rodriguez mentioned that ""the nation is living through a complex situation,"" and he recognized that access to information is a right; however, the diplomat avoided confirming that the cut was deliberate, nor did he explain why it happened, directing his comments to problems in the distribution of food and electricity. Shortly thereafter, journalist Arleen Rodriguez admitted on the Roundtable program that ""the cut"" to service had been deliberate. ""I understand, as a journalist, although it hurts me, the cut in social media because its where the war against Cuba is being carried out,"" she said, referring to another topic. Cuban citizens have expressed anger over this restriction that has kept them without communication in the middle of uncertainty. Whats more, we are talking about one of the highest-priced services in the country (1gb for 100 CUP ($4 USD) is the most economical option). In response to a complaint from a Facebook user, the Matanzas provincial government justified the limitation of access to a ""saturation in the lines"" and promised that they would transmit the complaint to the Etecsa authorities.

180,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/16/fake-news-proliferating-online-during-cuba-protests,"The government says they are spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics say it is the authorities themselves. False news reports have spread fast following unprecedented protests in Cuba. Among them: former President Raul Castro had fled to ally Venezuela, protesters had kidnapped a provincial Communist Party chief and Caracas was sending in troops. The Cuban government said they were spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics of the government said they may have come from the authorities themselves. Neither provided evidence for their claims and the Reuters news agency was unable to ascertain the origins of the stories. The government said the stories, which spread on Sunday on social media and messaging apps, were part of a broader US-backed attempt by counter-revolutionaries to destabilise the country. ""What calumnies, what lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel late on Wednesday, exposing some of the fake news stories on a televised roundtable. ""The way they are using social media is poisonous and alienating."" ""It is an expression of media terrorism,"" he said. Government critics said authorities could be planting the stories to muddy online waters with misinformation and sow confusion so that no one trusts future news of unrest. ""Often it is state security launching these kind of rumors to afterwards ... say they are foreign-directed campaigns to manipulate Cubans so people stop trusting in information circulating outside government control,"" wrote Mexican-based communications specialist Jose Raul Gallego on Facebook. The government and some of its most prominent critics urged Cubans to be careful not to share non-verified information. Some of the stories were amplified by Cubans abroad cheering on the protests. The proliferation of manufactured or misleading videos and content on social media has become a common feature of social protests around the world in recent years, including in Chile, Bolivia, the United States and France. Thousands took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilised. Early reports of protests on Sunday were also followed swiftly by internet outages and restrictions on social media and messaging platforms. Service was slowly returning to normal by Friday. The introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago and the subsequent flourishing of social media and independent news outlets in Cuba has been a key factor behind the protests. These tools have given Cubans a platform to share and amplify their frustrations and enabled the word to get out quickly when people are on the street, analysts say. Many Cubans learned of Sundays protests on messaging applications such as WhatsApp or on Facebook. Musician Alexander Delgado, a member of the Cuban reggaeton band Gente de Zona, taking part in a rally in solidarity with protesters in Cuba, in Little Havana neighbourhood in Miami, Florida, US [Marco Bello/Reuters] But Cubas government, which has long had a monopoly on mass media, warned citizens against believing news and images shared on social media that may have been manipulated. Posts shared thousands of times in recent days were mislabeled as Cuban protests. Some included photos that showed a large crowd during Cubas 2018 May Day march or a protest in Egypt in 2011. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez accused social media platforms of generally only launching investigations into suspected fake news when it hurt the ""powerful"". ""Its known which monopolies operate in the digital space ... how they work, in which countries they are headquarters ... and how much politics goes on,"" he told a news briefing on Tuesday. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reinaldo Escobar, the editor of independent news site 14ymedio, said that regardless of who published the fake news and the motivation, many Cubans now had the direct experience of participating in or observing genuine spontaneous demonstrations. ""This massive coming out of the closet of fear will have consequences,"" he said.",[],7/16/2021 22:09,Fake news proliferating online during Cuba protests,"['fake', 'media', 'say', 'spread', 'proliferating', 'critics', 'protests', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'social', 'online', 'messaging']","False news reports have spread fast following unprecedented protests in Cuba.

Jim McGovern (D-MA) stated that when former President Barack Obama softened American policy towards Cuba, ""people were sending more remittances to their families. You saw people supporting small businesses that were growing in Cuba. You saw more political space, a strengthening of civil society."" But former President Donald Trump ""turned everything back, and as a result, we see increased suffering on the island."" McGovern said that the Cuban government should respect the right of the Cuban people to protest against the problems on the island, free protesters they have arrested, and restore Internet access. He added that the Biden administration should recognize, as the Obama administration did, ""that our policy toward Cuba, for the last many decades, has been a miserable failure. This economic embargo, these sanctions that we have put in place have hurt average Cubans. They havent hurt the hardliners in the Cuban government."" McGovern further stated, ""When we began to ease things under the Obama administration, we actually saw a very different thing happen. One is that people were sending more remittances to their families. You saw people supporting small businesses that were growing in Cuba. You saw more political space, a strengthening of civil society. All those things are good. All those things help pave the way for a better future for the Cuban people. I mean, Trump -- I mean, Biden, at a minimum, ought to reverse Trumps additional sanctions, one of which, by the way, makes it difficult for a Cuban-American son or daughter living in the United States to send remittances to their mother or father in Cuba to help them get through these difficult times. I mean, thats a rotten, cruel thing that Trump did. We ought to be able to reverse it right away. And when people say, the Cuban government will take advantage of that, certainly, we can figure out a delivery system that will get it to the people who need it. But if we want to help the Cuban people, enough of the Cold War rhetoric. I mean, lets get down to the business of formulating a new, more constructive policy, one that actually helps the Cuban people."" McGovern concluded that the Obama administration ""was on the right track. When Trump became president, he turned everything back, and as a result, we see increased suffering on the island.""

(AP Photo / Ismael Francisco) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban officials rallied tens of thousands of supporters in the streets on Saturday -- nearly a week after they were stunned by the most widespread protests in decades. President Miguel Diaz-Canel-- accompanied by 90-year-old former President Raul Castro -- appeared on the seafront Malecon boulevard that had seen some of the largest protests against shortages and the political system the previous weekend. He made an impassioned speech blaming unrest on the U.S. and its economic embargo, ""the blockade, aggression and terror,"" as a crowd waved Cuban flags and those of the July 26 Movement that Fidel Castro led during Cubas revolution. ""The enemy has returned to throw all it has at destroying the sacred unity and tranquility of the citizens,"" he said. ADVERTISEMENT He ended without the traditional cry of ""Homeland or Death!"" -- a slogan mocked last week by protesters shouting, ""Homeland and life!"" Havana has been returning to normal in recent days, even if mobile internet data service - which authorities cut on Sunday - remained limited. ""There is political and social erosion ... There is a lot of disgust, we must talk more, do more things and things that were done wrong should be rectified,"" said Abel Alba, a 50-year-old civil engineer, speaking Friday. ""The president has tried to smooth things over a bit"" but he waited ""too long"" to listen to the demands of the people in the streets. The protests began Sunday when thousands of Cubans marched along the Malecon and elsewhere to protest food and medicine shortages, power outages and some even calling for political change. Smaller protests continued MOnday and Tuesday. Diaz-Canel initially responded by pointing to U.S. economic sanctions, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a social media campaign by Cuban American groups. But he later acknowledged some responsibility by Cubas leaders. With this in mind, Cuban Cabinet ministers announced a mix of measures including permits for travelers to import food and medicine without limits and allowing people to use their ration books to obtain subsidized goods outside their hometowns. ""The Cuban government has just shown that it could have allowed the entry of food and medicine without quantity limits or tariffs all along but chose not to do so for more than a year of the pandemic,"" wrote Jose Jasan Nieves, director of the independent digital newspaper, El Toque. ""People twisted their arms."" ADVERTISEMENT Authorities reiterated their intentions to finish authorizing small and medium-sized companies as a source of employment as well as a program for state companies to pay more than the current salary scale. What officials also made clear is that they are not willing to make changes to the islands political model. Street vendor Marlen Rodriguez, 66, was not optimistic following the governments announcements. ""There are no medicines, there is nothing, there is no food."" According to Diaz-Canel, there were four sectors involved in the protests: radical supporters of the United States who waved that countrys flag during the protests and demanded intervention from Washington, criminals who took advantage of the situation to loot, people genuinely desperate due to the impact of the crisis on their daily lives and young people who feel disenfranchised. The marches turned violent with police clashing with protesters, patrol cars being destroyed, shops looted, windows broken, stones thrown and violent arrests and injuries. ""When people with weak minds let themselves be influenced, these things like what happened on Sunday occur,"" said Tal(ia Linares, a 19-year-old student who turned out for Saturdays rally. ""So we are here to show that that isnt Cuban youth."" One government opponent died in the protests and the exact number of people arrested is not known. Government opponents have said on social media that the number is more than 100. On Friday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, called for release of the protesters. The measures announced by the government ""are positive measures, but they are insufficient,"" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny Perez. ""Without affecting the ideology, there is a lot of space in which the state can take action,"" he said, mentioning permits for private entrepreneurs to import goods without going through the state monopoly, allowing foreign companies to install retail markets or raising the ceiling for agricultural prices in order to increase supply. But political analysts said the economic challenges are great. ""I think the government is just trying to signal to people that it understands their desperation and that its going to try to alleviate some of the misery that theyre experiencing. The problem is that the government just doesnt have much in the way of resources that it can devote to doing that,"" said William LeoGrande, an expert on Cuba at the American University in the United States. LeoGrande said the unrest in Cuba and the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise have put the Caribbean back on the agenda of U.S. President Joe Biden. ""There is no question that the demonstrations in Cuba and the assassination of Haitis president and the resulting unrest there have pushed the Caribbean to the top of President Bidens foreign policy agenda, even though they would have preferred that it stayed on the back burner for a much longer time,"" he said. ""What the administration will do on Cuba is still very much up in the air.""",['Andrea Rodríguez'],7/17/2021 4:00,Cuba government rallies backers following big protests,"['president', 'backers', 'malecon', 'cuban', 'thousands', 'protests', 'unrest', 'cuba', 'things', 'political', 'following', 'big', 'rallies', 'protesters']","""The enemy has returned to throw all it has at destroying the sacred unity and tranquility of the citizens,"" he said.

It arrived, to their surprise, last Sunday, when Cubans on the island rushed the streets to denounce a Communist government that has left them oppressed, sick and hungry. Finally, exiles thought, the Cuban people were taking matters into their own hands. The uprising, led by artists and other young activists on the island, inspired thousands of their relatives, friends and former countrymen to protest in solidarity in Miami, Tampa and other cities in Florida, where three generations of exiles and their progeny have dreamed of a free Cuba. Even as the protests in Cuba have appeared to quiet down following the arrests of many protesters, the gatherings in Florida, including large ones in Miami, continued throughout the week. The flash of unrest re-energized exiles hopes for an end to the Communist regime, a cause that had, to some extent, languished after so many years of dashed hopes.

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity. A march was held Saturday in Hialeah for human rights in Cuba. Thats what those involved called the amazing show of unity. Local 10's Hatzel Vela joined the hundreds in Hialeah marching along West 16th Avenue for more than ten blocks on Saturday morning. Along the march, the crowd sang songs that have become synonymous to the Cuban struggle. It marked the seventh consecutive day of protests since the unprecedented uprising in Havana last weekend. Almost a week later and the love of patria, of country, remains vibrant in all generations. ""In 1980 my grandfather came here on the Mariel boat lift in search for freedom,"" said protestor Yazmin Gonzalez. ""His bravery is what led me to be here today."" The crowd started to gather at the corner of West 16 Avenue and 49th Street. Ad Homeland and life has become the anthem here and on the island. Like many here in South Florida, 25-year-old Yvelisse Suarez, who lives in Kendall, is concerned about her relatives back in Holguin. As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity. ""Im here for my parents, for my grandparents, for every family member that I have left there,"" said protestor Yvelisse Suarez. ""They dont have food. They dont have medicine and they dont have anything."" Daniel Rodriguez told Local 10 News his spoke to his mother in Cienfuegos Saturday morning, and that she tells him repression is high and Cubans are fearful. ""If you even like a comment against the dictatorship, they can come to your house and drag you out to the jail,"" he said. In Havanas Malecon, thousands took part in a staged pro-government protest. Many were bused in, and for the first time since the widespread protests, former leader Raul Castro was seen. On Friday, the Cuban community marched through Little Havana, calling for freedom on the communist island. Ad The group of nearly 150 people marched more than two miles, from Cafe Versailles toward Domino Park. Eduardo Moya with Lifestyle Miami, along with other organizers, planned Fridays protest. The hope is that the gatherings seen all week long will prompt change in Cuba that will ultimately free its people. ""We want to show them that the fight is on this side as well too, its not just them over there,"" said Moya. ""And continue to support them in any way we can."" The protests will continue during the weekend, with several scheduled for Saturday; one is planned at the Freedom Tower in Downtown Miami at 5:30 p.m. in which people like Willy Chirino and Emilio Stefan, among others, are expected to be there and speak at a press conference, scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Another protest is happening by boat in Biscayne Bay Saturday at 5:30 p.m. as well.","['Annaliese Garcia', 'Hatzel Vela', 'Bridgette Matter']",7/17/2021 14:14,Protests continue across South Florida in show of solidarity for those suffering in Cuba,"['streets', 'south', 'parts', 'florida', 'taking', 'nation', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'continue', 'ongoing', 'suffering', 'solidarity']","As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity.

The rapid-response brigades, which are made up of civilian snitches -- neighbors, co-workers and plainclothes cops loyal to the regime -- are out in force after protesters demanding food, medicine and freedom took to the streets beginning July 11, according to dissident bloggers on the island. Cuban journalist Yoani Sanchez reported an increase in the activity of the brigades, and ""a heavy police presence"" on the streets of many large cities across the country on her ""Ventana 14"" podcast Friday. ""The government lost the street and are using anything they can to stop the protests,"" said Ted Henken, a Baruch College sociology professor and expert on Cuba. Cuban dissident Yoani Sanchez reported a ""heavy police presence"" on the streets of many large Cuban cities. Bloomberg via Getty Images The brigades are vigilante organizations first deployed to spy on citizens in the 1990s, at the beginning of the so-called Special Period, when the Soviet Union withdrew its economic support ushering in rationing of food and medicine and leading to a major popular revolt in 1994. ""They never stopped functioning,"" said Andy Gomez, the retired dean of International Studies at the University of Miami. The brigades are often combined with undercover cops, under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, which oversees domestic security and intelligence gathering, he said. Information collected from the brigades are used to target government opponents, many of whom are arrested and tortured, often held for years without due process, Gomez said.

Many are fiercely loyal to the regime, while others are forced to sign up to snitch if they want to keep their government jobs. The spies linked to MININT, as the Ministry of the Interior is known, are universally feared on the island, much more so than the Cuban military, which has never been deployed against Cubans, Gomez told The Post. ""Cuba has never called on the armed forces to put down any social unrest because they consider themselves an army of the Cuban people,"" Gomez said. Since the start of the protests, more than 200 people have been detained, according to human rights groups. Authorities have also raided the homes of dozens of demonstrators who they have identified from videos of the protests, Henken told The Post.

Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images ""I was arrested with the same contempt as Hitler treated Jews in Nazi Germany,"" said playwright Yunior Garcia Aguillera, a well-known opposition figure, who co-hosts the popular weekly podcast El Enjambre. Garcia, who wrote about his brief detention in a Facebook post Thursday, described how he shared a cell with several other protestors who ""were all Cubans, fighting for a free and prosperous Cuba ... a Cuba without dictators."" When protests first spread across Cuba this week, ETECSA, the state telecommunications company, shut down the Internet, accusing the US of funding a cyber-campaign to foment rebellion on the island. ""These days, the US doesnt need missiles or Marines,"" said Bruno Rodriguez, the Cuban foreign minister. ""They have bots and automated cyber accounts."" While the Castro dynasty that ran Cuba since the 1959 revolution officially ended when Fidel Castros 90-year-old brother Raul stepped down as leader of the Communist party in April, he is still very much in control, even though Miguel Diaz-Canel is president of the country. ""Its still Castroism without the Castros in charge,"" said Henken. Raul Castro made a rare public appearance alongside Diaz-Canel Saturday as Diaz-Canel blamed the uprising on the decades-long US embargo against the island. On Friday he slammed President Biden for calling Cuba ""a failed state."" ""A failed state is that which, to please a reactionary and blackmailing minority, is capable of doing damage to 11 million humans,"" Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. ""If President Joseph Biden was really worried about the humanitarian issues facing the Cuban people, he would eliminate the 243 measures imposed by President Trump, including the more than 50 cruelly imposed during the pandemic."" The advent of the mobile internet in Cuba, which came in December 2018, is the main reason behind the build-up of protests on the island, according to Henken, an editor of the recently published book, ""Cubas Digital Revolution: Citizen Innovation and State Policy. ""Everyone involved in any protest or march could suddenly document in real time using Twitter and Facebook Live, and no longer needed to be tied to a computer or hotspot,"" he said. ""Its a big blow to totalitarianism, which only thrives by keeping people ignorant and isolated.""","['Social Links For Isabel Vincent', 'Contact The Author']",7/17/2021 15:38,"Cuba resorting to citizen spies, plainclothes cops to crush dissent","['spies', 'streets', 'president', 'state', 'according', 'crush', 'cuban', 'dissent', 'cops', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'citizen', 'brigades', 'gomez', 'plainclothes', 'resorting']","After stemming historic protests across Cuba by shutting down digital communications this week, the islands beleaguered Communist government is now beefing up a more traditional way of stifling opposition -- citizen spies.

187,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/17/cuba-president-denounces-unrest-as-a-lie-calls-protest-images,"Days after anti-government demonstrations, President Diaz-Canel says 'what the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie. Cubas President Miguel Diaz-Canel has denounced what he said was a false narrative over unrest on the Caribbean island, speaking alongside ex-president Raul Castro during a rally before thousands of supporters in Havana. ""What the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie,"" Diaz-Canel said on Saturday, denouncing the dissemination of ""false images"" on social networks where they ""encourage and glorify the outrage and destruction of property."" Diaz-Canels comments come six days after historic demonstrations against the government. On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities around the island shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""Were hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested, including independent journalists and opposition activists, since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. There is an ""overflowing hatred on social networks,"" the president said. Cesen la mentira, la infamia y el odio. #Cuba es profundamente alergica al odio. !Y jamas sera tierra de odio! No se construye nada bueno del odio. El odio nos roba tiempo para amar y hasta el amor mismo. A #Cuba, #PonleCorazon pic.twitter.com/1fM6flQqPO -- Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez (@DiazCanelB) July 17, 2021 Translation: [Stop the] lies, infamy and hatred. #Cuba is deeply allergic to hatred. And it will never be a land of hatred! Nothing good is built out of hatred. Hate robs us of time to love and even love itself. TO #Cuba, #Putyourheart, Diaz-Canel tweeted. Protesters took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest against power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party political system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilised. Cuba cut off internet access on the island on Sunday and restored it on Wednesday, but access to social media and messaging apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter remained blocked on 3G and 4G networks. Diaz-Canel, who accuses the United States of having provoked the protests, said the ""lie"" was not committed ""by chance or mistake; all this is the cold calculation of an unconventional-war manual"". ""Born to conquer and not to be conquered!"" shouted the crowd at the rally, which had gathered at dawn on the Malecon, Havanas famed oceanfront boulevard. Castro, 90, was drawn out of retirement by the gravity of the protests. Shortly before the rally began, police arrested a man who shouted ""Patria y Vida"" (""Homeland and Life""), the title of a protest rap song that became the anthem of the anti-government demonstrators, according to AFP news agency. The official newspaper, Granma, said similar rallies were called in other cities including Santiago de Cuba, Bayamo, Camaguey and Santa Clara.",[],7/17/2021 15:55,Cuba president rejects coverage of unrest as a 'lie',"['hatred', 'president', 'lie', 'diazcanel', 'rally', 'odio', 'y', 'unrest', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'coverage', 'social', 'rejects']","Days after anti-government demonstrations, President Diaz-Canel says 'what the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie.

189,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-government-holds-mass-rally-havana-after-protests-2021-07-17/,"HAVANA, July 17 (Reuters) - Raul Castro was among thousands who attended a government-organized rally in Havana on Saturday to denounce the U.S. trade embargo and reaffirm their support for Cuba's revolution, a week after unprecedented protests rocked the communist-run country. Government supporters gathered on the city's seafront boulevard before dawn to wave Cuban flags and photos of late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. The latter retired as Communist Party leader in April but promised to continue fighting for the revolution as a ""foot soldier"". The rally was a reaction to demonstrations that erupted nationwide last Sunday amid widespread shortages of basic goods, demands for political rights and the island nation's worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register The government admitted some shortcomings this week but mostly blamed the protests on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, told the crowd that Cuba's ""enemy has once again thrown itself into destroying citizen's sacred unity and tranquility."" He said it was no small matter to call a rally as the country saw increasing numbers of COVID cases: ""We convened you to denounce once more the blockade, the aggression and terror."" 1/5 People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Read More Authorities said similar rallies were held nationwide. ""This revolution will continue for a long time,"" said Margaritza Arteaga, a state social worker who attended the rally in Havana. Workers had been convened by neighborhood block committees, known as the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, she said, and a state bus had picked her up at 4 a.m. Shortly before the rally in Havana officially began, authorities removed a man shouting anti-government slogans including ""freedom"" from the crowd. The number of those detained during or after protests has grown as new reports trickle in amid irregular outages in internet and messaging applications on the island where the state has a monopoly on telecommunications. The latest tally from exiled rights group Cubalex put those detained at 450, although some have since been released. Activists have accused authorities of repression as some videos have emerged on social media of police beating protesters. The government has not yet given official figures for those detained although it has said it has arrested those it suspects of instigating unpatriotic unrest or of carrying out vandalism. State television has broadcast images of people looting Cuba's controversial dollar stores and overturning empty police cars.

190,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/17/cuba-president-slams-social-media-hatred-after-protests,"Havana, Cuba - The Cuban government held a massive rally in the early hours of Saturday morning on Havanas Malecon, the citys famed corniche, at the end of a week of unrest that spurred a slew of international criticism. Crowds for the ""Act of Revolutionary Reaffirmation"" rally in the Cuban capital, which the government said numbered 100,000, arrived before the sun rose and spilled onto the highway near the United States embassy. Other rallies were held across the country. People had travelled in by buses and trucks and were met by the music of Silvio Rodriguez, one of the few famous Cuban musicians not to criticise the governments fierce response to the protests last week. ""Im here to support the Cuban revolution,"" Yilian Llanes told Al Jazeera. ""To give my support as a representative of young Cubans, and to express my discontent with the violent protests that took place in our country."" Those protests began last Sunday in the town of San Antonio de los Banos. Residents were furious with hours-long blackouts but people quickly spilled onto streets across the island due to anger over months of food and medicine shortages. People participate in a rally in Havana [Alexandre Meneghin/Reuters] Police cars were turned over, a few hated MLC stores - where necessities can only be purchased in foreign currencies - were looted, and clashes with police and government supporters broke out. The states response - arresting hundreds, including protesters who were pulled from the crowds and detained without having their families informed of where they were - earned a rebuke from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Friday. ""All those detained for exercising their rights must be promptly released,"" Michelle Bachelet said. 'Viva Cuba Libre People began being bused to Havanas Vedado neighbourhood from local party headquarters from 4:30am (08:30 GMT) on Saturday for the rally. They carried party flags, banners and placards showing revolutionary heroes such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Raul Castro, the 90-year-old brother of Fidel who stepped down as the first secretary of the Communist Party in April, made an appearance but did not speak. Instead, the microphone was given to his successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel. ""Viva Cuba Libre,"" shouted Diaz-Canel, before launching into an attack on social media, access to which the government had restricted for much of the last week. ""Hate robs us of the time to love. We have experienced that in the last week on social media. The owners of these networks, the dictators of those algorithms, have opened their platforms to hatred, without the slightest ethical concern,"" he said. 'Viva Cuba Libre, shouted Diaz-Canel, before launching into a furious attack on social media [Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] ""It is a hatred that fractures friends, families, society and threatens to make many of our values useless."" In contrast to last weekends protests, the crowd on Saturday was older. People had been called up by their workplaces and many wore the T-shirts of state industries, such as oil distributor CUPET. Others wore pro-Cuba slogans. Still, young people participated in the rally, including 27-year-old Kenneth Fowler, who told Al Jazeera he is a professor at the University of Havana and had come with students from the chemistry faculty. ""Last weekend we had an attempt against the safety of our society,"" he said. ""It was part of a much greater attack by the US government and the capitalist system. The president called for people to come forward and defend our achievements. So thats why Im here."" On Thursday night, during a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, US president Joe Biden made it clear that he would continue Donald Trumps policy of denying Cubans money by continuing to block remittances sent by relatives abroad. The UNs Bachelet also criticised the 60-year US embargo. COVID-19 infections Meanwhile, news of the rally spurred criticism from those who have been watching COVID-19 flood every corner of the island. The average daily number of new cases has risen above 6,000 and hospitals are being overwhelmed in several provinces. Amilcar Perez Riverol, a post-doctoral fellow in molecular biology at Sao Paulo State University in Brazil and a veteran of Cubas laboratories, has been a staunch supporter of Cubas health workers and scientists as they have fought the virus and developed homegrown vaccines. He tweeted that for a country that is currently fifth in the world and first in Latin America in terms of infections per capita, the decision to rally seemed disastrous. ""These rallies arent good news for the control of the current surge in Cuba. Not only because of the potential infections during the rallies but for the message they send,"" Perez Riverol told Al Jazeera on Saturday. But on the Malecon, Fowler said a show of unity was too important to worry about the further spread of the virus. ""We need to show our decision to fight together, I think that is more important,"" he said. ""And you know what? I didnt hear anyone telling that to the protesters last weekend.""",['Ruaridh Nicoll'],7/17/2021 18:28,Cuba's president slams social media 'hatred' after protests,"['hatred', 'party', 'media', 'president', 'rally', 'slams', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'jazeera', 'social', 'cubas', 'told', 'rallies']","""Im here to support the Cuban revolution,"" Yilian Llanes told Al Jazeera.

191,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/two-asylum-policies-cubans-boat-southwest-border-odds,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The Biden administration this week warned Cubans attempting to enter the U.S. by boat that they would be turned back or sent to a third country -- all while tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the southern border are being let in. ""Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week about migrants from Cuba and Haiti coming across the Florida Straits. MAYORKAS SAYS MIGRANTS FLEEING CUBA, HAITI BY SEA WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER US As political protests against the authoritarian communist regime rock the country, there are fears of a spike in migrants fleeing. Mayorkas said DHS has not yet seen a surge, but warned that those coming over would not come in -- but could be referred to a third country. ""They are returned by vessels of interdiction. If individuals establish a well-founded fear of persecution or torture, they are referred to third countries for settlement,"" he said. ""They will not enter the United States."" While Mayorkas comments do not reflect a new policy by DHS, and such policies have been carried out by different administrations for years, it is a stark contrast to the Biden administrations approach to the southern border. There, the administration has ended the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) which kept migrants in Mexico and the Asylum Cooperative Agreements (ACAs), which were agreements with Northern Triangle countries to have migrants claim asylum there instead rather than in the U.S. Additionally, while it is expelling single adults via Title 42 public health protections, it is not expelling migrant families or unaccompanied children -- and has made it a focus to quicken the process by which families and children are processed and released into the United States, often without court dates. ARIZONA AG BRNOVICH URGES BIDEN TO REVERSE REPORTED TITLE 42 REPEAL AFTER BORDER NUMBERS RISE AGAIN His remarks drew criticism of double standards from the right, and accusations of cruelty from the left. ""Why doesn't he say this to illegals crossing our southern border?"" Texas Rep. Lance Gooden tweeted. NBC News meanwhile reported how human rights activists had described the decision as ""shameful"" and ""disappointing."" Among those criticisms was the contrast between what those encountered at the land border, and those encountered at sea. MIGRANT ARRESTS AT SOUTHERN BORDER ROSE YET AGAIN IN JUNE TO 188,000, TOPPING 1M THIS FISCAL YEAR Former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News that the approaches to each of the issues were inconsistent, and noted that Cuban nationals who entered via the southern border could be processed into the U.S. and would not be sent to a third country - which is completely different to what happens if they come by boat. ""So if you're Cuban and you make it to Mexico and you walk across the southern border illegally, they are not returning you to a third country,"" he said in an interview this week. ""But if you are Cuban and you try and flee by boat over the Florida Straits then they are according to the secretary, so its very inconsistent."" He argued that the policy the administration was pursuing with maritime interdictions, namely sending migrants to third countries, was similar to the Trump-era policy at the border which the Biden administration quickly unraveled. ""If they want to resettle folks claiming asylum in a third country, that's exactly what the Trump administration was doing for the southwest border, that's why we had the ACAs, its why we had MPP -- that's the whole strategy,"" he said. ""It should also be the policy, it doesn't matter how you come to the country, it should be the policy wherever were at, and that was the type of policy we were working on and getting to in the Trump administration so there would not be this rush and this crisis that you see today,"" he said. A DHS spokesperson told Fox News that there has not been a change in policy, and the policy has long been to return those interdicted at sea to their country of nationality or to a third country for resettlement. ""Individuals encountered on US soil are processed under laws governing such processing. Third country resettlement is an option for those who are interdicted at sea,"" the spokesperson said. There is also a question of the particular countries' human rights records. The communist regime in Cuba is known for its brutality against those who oppose it. Wolf said its record is one of the worst in the hemisphere, and so one may expect nationals from there to be a priority for asylum requests. ""This administration talks a lot about asylees and needing to protect individuals that are being persecuted, and I think of all the countries we see, at least in this hemisphere, except for maybe Venezuela, Cuba is probably the most oppressive government we have,"" he said. ""So the question is why are they not allowing folks from Cuba to resettle in the U.S. like they are folks from Guatemala when the asylum claim from Cuba is likely greater.""

On Friday, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced there had been more than 188,000 migrants encounters at the border, including more than 55,000 family units. Of those family units, only just over 8,000 had been turned away via Title 42, the stats show.",['Adam Shaw'],7/17/2021 20:32,Two asylum policies?

WASHINGTON D.C. - The fight for Cuban freedom continues to resonate across South Florida, while in Washington D.C. a so-called caravan for Cuba is taking its concerns straight to the White House. With signs held high and Cuban flags raised, crowds gathered Saturday to call for freedom for the island nation. Some South Floridians hit the road and made the 15-hour drive from Miami to tell the government to take action in Cuba. ""With this many people get together and chant someone has to listen,"" said Amanda Velazquez, a protester from Miami. ""We are trying to tell (President Joe) Biden we are here in your front door on our knees to help us to help our people. ""They are suffering through a system that completely failed them and oppressed them for 60 years."" Added Lillian Fonseca, a protester from Hialeah: ""If military wont be able to intervene because I understand thats not a possibility, at least if we can give them free WIFI."" Ad Florida Senator Marco Rubio took to the senate floor Friday to support the protesters. ""In 62 years of communist tyranny on the island we have never seen what is now up to 40 cities to which people took to the streets,"" Rubio said. Many of those gathered outside the north lawn still have family living in the communist regime and hope their efforts lead to change and the fall of the dictatorship.",['Ben Kennedy'],7/17/2021 22:15,Group from South Florida makes trip to Washington D.C. and protests for Cuba outside White House,"['dc', 'south', 'straight', 'makes', 'florida', 'white', 'taking', 'tell', 'cuban', 'trip', 'protests', 'group', 'outside', 'house', 'freedom', 'washington', 'took']","The fight for Cuban freedom continues to resonate across South Florida, while in Washington D.C. a so-called caravan for Cuba is taking its concerns straight to the White House.

Its time to do more -- by acting to secure internet access on the island. Since last Sunday, Cubans have been taking to the streets across the nation to demand freedom from the dictatorship, adequate access to food and medicine and the resignation of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The regime responded by telling police to open fire and by shutting down Web access to stop demonstrators from communicating via Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram and sharing images of his goons violence. In a letter to the White House, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla. -- and a Cuban American) outlined several steps Washington should take beyond well-wishing. The key: enabling open and free satellite Internet access. Biden said Thursday that hes considering it, telling reporters: ""Theyve cut off access to the Internet. Were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access."" That sounds like a stall: The feds should know that already, since the ideas been suggested for years, for example when Irans rulers shut down the Web to squelch protests -- and its an obvious tool to help freedom-lovers around the globe in such situations. People protest Cubas government in Miami on July 12, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Delay is deadly. ""Time is of the essence here,"" as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) notes: ""Every day that the regime has to black out the truth is a day they can get the upper hand on this."" But it looks like the White House is slow-walking any response -- or, rather, leaving it to drawn-out interagency discussions, as Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for the State Departments bureau of Western Hemisphere affairs, told Politico, even as she called the idea ""something that were very interested in promoting and advocating for."" Sen. Lindsey Graham said last week of Bidens slowness to even speak up in solidarity with the protesters that the prez is ""like a deer in the headlights when it comes to standing up to oppression."" That seems to extend to jumping on the internet idea. Desperate, hungry and oppressed Cubans are waving American flags as a sign of freedom in the streets of Havana: The least Uncle Sam can do is make sure their voices ring around the world.",[],7/18/2021 0:57,Biden needs to move fast to provide satellite internet for silenced Cuban protesters,"['silenced', 'streets', 'access', 'white', 'biden', 'web', 'cuban', 'internet', 'satellite', 'regime', 'fast', 'rfla', 'freedom', 'telling', 'needs', 'provide', 'protesters']","So far, all President Joe Biden has offered the tens of thousands of protesters risking their lives to call for freedom in Cuba are a few words of support.

194,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/17/cuba-protesters-covered-in-blood-stage-die-in-outside-of-white-house/,"Three adults and two children dressed in ""Young Pioneer"" uniforms laid in front of the White House in Washington, DC, on Saturday covered in ""blood"" and draped in Cuban flags, demanding the U.S. government help anti-communist protesters. The uniforms are those used in Cuban schools; ""Young Pioneers"" are children who excel in communist indoctrination programs at a young age and receive advanced education and benefits, recognizable by their red kerchiefs. ""Pioneer"" programs are common in all communist countries. As several hundred #SOSCuba protesters chanted ""Freedom for Cuba"" outside the gates of President Joe Bidens home on Pennsylvania Avenue, a small group of protesters performed what is called a ""die-in"" to represent Cubans slain by Cubas brutal communist regime. As they laid still on the concrete, the protesters were surrounded by signs. ""Youre sitting by while we die,"" one of the signs read. ""Cubas blood is on your hands,"" another read. Protesters came from all over the country, including groups who bused from Miami to D.C., to participate in the demonstration. Protests have sparked in the U.S. and around the world since thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Cuba last Sunday and throughout the week, calling for the end of Fidel Castros 62-year dictatorship. While Castro himself died in 2016, the Castro family continues to control the island through its domination of the military. The news of protests in Cuba spread via social media before the Cuban government shut down the islands internet. More than 40 municipalities have participated so far, making it the largest anti-government protest on the island in decades. Since protests in Cuba began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten people in the streets. Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people so far, Breitbart News reported. Current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued late Sunday. Breitbart News spoke with several protesters, many of whom came from Cuba directly or have family who did. The protesters warned of communism in the United States and spoke of atrocities in Cuba, including how young adults and teens are being forcefully taken from their homes by the government and made to fight against their own family and friends. Demonstrators in D.C. cloaked themselves in Cuban and American flags and called on the Biden Administration to intervene in Cuba to put an end to the grave human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Cuban government. Many protesters held signs on Saturday condemning Biden for his inaction so far. ""Biden, history will remember how you turn your back to Cuba & all the Cubans who voted for you,"" one sign read. Other signs insisted Biden take military action rather than engage in talks with a murderous regime. ""Joe Biden, we need military intervention in Cuba, not dialogue or business with the fucking government,"" another sign read. Protesters around the U.S. who have joined the Cuban people from afar, as well as some politicians, have ""escalated their calls for military intervention against the Castro regime to defend the lives of unarmed, peaceful Cuban protesters,"" Breitbart News reported. A petition at Change.org urging military intervention has attracted nearly 400,000 signatures as of Wednesday, suggesting the idea is more popular than many establishment media outlets in the United States have suggested. Bidens response to protests in Cuba has been criticized for being unenthusiastic and slow. On Wednesdays broadcast of the Fox News Channels Fox & Friends, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he wished the Biden administration denounced the tyranny of Cuba with ""half the passion"" that they have for denouncing Republican elected officials. During a press conference on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is reviewing its policies toward Cuba. ""And as we look at those policies, one of the big factors is ensuring we are not doing anything to pad the pockets of a corrupt authoritarian regime,"" Psaki said, while also suggesting Biden is considering providing humanitarian aid. President Joe Biden said Thursday the United States was considering ways to force open Internet access in Cuba, which he called a ""failed state."" He also said he would give Cuba Chinese coronavirus vaccines if he knew the shots would make it to the Cuban people. Notably, the Biden Administration did not explicitly condemn communism until several days after protests began. Psaki also asserted that Cuban protesters yelling ""freedom!"" during anti-communist protests were actually demanding ""freedom from rising COVID cases."" Biden issued an initial statement on Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people,"" but he failed to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/18/2021 1:46,Cuba Protesters Stage Die-In Outside White House,"['young', 'called', 'white', 'biden', 'military', 'cuban', 'diein', 'protests', 'outside', 'house', 'cuba', 'stage', 'united', 'administration', 'protesters']","The news of protests in Cuba spread via social media before the Cuban government shut down the islands internet.

195,https://www.trtworld.com/americas/cuban-president-denounces-unrest-as-a-lie-during-mass-rally-48466,"Fast News Thousands of people attended the government-organised rally in Havana to denounce the US trade embargo and reaffirm their support for Cuba's revolution, a week after unprecedented protests rocked the communist-run country. Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz Canel waves a Cuban national flag as he delivers a speech during a rally in Havana, Cuba on July 17, 2021. (Reuters) Cuba's President Miguel Diaz Canel has denounced what he said was a false narrative over unrest on the Caribbean island, as the Communist regime vigorously pushed back against suggestions of historically widespread discontent. ""What the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie,"" Diaz Canel said, speaking during a rally alongside ex-president Raul Castro and before thousands of supporters who had gathered on the Malecon, Havana's famed oceanfront boulevard. Government supporters gathered on the city's seafront boulevard before dawn to wave Cuban flags and photos of late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. The latter retired as Communist Party leader in April but promised to continue fighting for the revolution as a ""foot soldier"". The rally, and similar ones in other cities, constituted the regime's first public response to the anti-government protests that unexpectedly brought thousands to Cuban streets last weekend. Organizers described the event on Saturday as one of ""revolutionary reaffirmation."" READ MORE: Whats spurring anti-government protests in Cuba? 'Down with the Yankees!' Cries from the crowd - ""Down with the Yankees!"" and ""We were born to conquer, not be conquered!"" - echoed the anti-imperialist language of the original Cuban revolutionary, former president Fidel Castro. Diaz-Canel decried what he said was the dissemination of ""false images"" on social networks that ""glorify the outrage and destruction of property."" Those images, he said, had caused ""immeasurable damage to the national soul."" On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""We're hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. There is an ""overflowing hatred on social networks,"" the president insisted on Saturday. His supporters, summoned from work places and universities, waved red-blue-and-white Cuban flags and the banner of the 1959 revolution. They enthusiastically applauded both Diaz Canel and Raul Castro. The presence of the 90-year-old Castro, drawn out of retirement because of the gravity of the situation, was noteworthy. He wore his olive-green general's uniform, harkening back to his revolutionary role alongside brother Fidel. ""Everyone who feels something for the revolution, who felt something for Fidel, for all he did for this country and that we must continue to do, knows what Raul's presence here means,"" said one rally participant, 65-year-old Carlos Cruz. Diaz-Canel said the ""lie"" about widespread protests was not committed ""by chance or mistake; all this is the cold calculation of an unconventional-war manual."" READ MORE: One dead as crackdown against Cuban protesters continues Protests amid economic crisis After last weekend's protests, Cuba cut off internet access on the island for three days. Even after access was restored, social media and messaging apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter remained blocked on 3G and 4G networks. Social media is the only way Cubans can reach independent news outlets, while messaging apps are their main means of communicating among themselves. US President Joe Biden has said Washington is considering ways to ease internet restrictions, though analysts have warned it could be tricky for technological and political reasons. The rallies were the largest since the revolution and came as the country endures its worst economic crisis in 30 years, with chronic shortages of electricity, food and medicine amid a spike in coronavirus infections. The island of 11.2 million people recorded 6,062 new cases of Covid-19, and 52 deaths, in the preceding 24 hours, the authorities said. The toll stands at 275,608 cases and 1,843 deaths. ""With or without the pandemic, we have to defend (the revolution),"" said 73-year-old teacher Hector Roman, who wore a protective mask. Havana, under US sanctions since 1962, has blamed the show of discontent on Washington pursuing a ""policy of economic suffocation to provoke social unrest."" Biden called Cuba a ""failed state"" on Thursday and said its leaders were ""repressing their citizens."" He said the US was prepared to potentially send significant amounts of Covid vaccine to the island. Cuba has also been developing its own vaccines. Shortly before the rally began, police arrested a man who shouted ""Patria y Vida"" (""Homeland and Life""), the title o f a protest rap song which has become the anthem of anti-government demonstrators. The official newspaper Granma said similar rallies were called in cities including Santiago de Cuba, Bayamo, Camaguey and Santa Clara.

MIAMI - A large protest in downtown Miami happened outside the Freedom Tower Saturday afternoon and into the evening. Everyone in the crowd shared a connection to the communist country. Joel Gandara was just 4 years old when he came from Cuba on a boat. ""When the boat would go up, all I would see is the sky,"" he said. Rosa Iglesas, who left the island when she was 19, has a similar story. ""What my country needed is the same thing I came here looking for; freedom,"" she said. Iglesas daughter, is now pushing for freedom along with her. ""My parents came from Cuba, and they gave me a better life here, they gave me freedom,"" said Gabriella Quinitero. They were some of the thousands who came out to the Freedom Tower on Saturday, a landmark for Cubans seeking a better life. Thousands gathered outside Downtown Miami's Freedom Tower to protest for Cuba. (WPLG) The massive rally marked the seventh straight day of protests in South Florida, with many calling on President Joe Biden to take action. The unprecedented uprisings come as conditions in Cuba continue to deteriorate, problems only made worse by the recent pandemic. Ad The rally ended with the illumination of the Freedom Tower in the colors of the Cuban flag. Even FTX Arena, the home area for the Miami Heat located right across the street, displayed a message of solidarity as well.",['Trent Kelly'],7/18/2021 12:50,"Massive crowd protests outside Freedom Tower in downtown Miami, calling for Cuban freedom","['rally', 'massive', 'protest', 'large', 'cuban', 'crowd', 'protests', 'outside', 'cuba', 'freedom', 'downtown', 'calling', 'came', 'miami', 'tower']","A large protest in Downtown Miami happened outside the Freedom Tower Saturday afternoon and into the evening.

REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS: What's cruel is the way that the communist regime treats its people. There are two classes in Cuba; one is the ruling class, run by the communists, and then there is everyone else who live in squalor. They don't have access to food, they don't have access to medicine, they don't have access to the basic necessities -- and it's certainly not because of the embargo. Look, Cuba does business with nearly every country in the world, and for six decades they remained a communist regime. So Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is nothing more than a communist sympathizer who wants to bring socialism to the United States of America and I'm sure she sympathizes with the regime in Cuba. But the reality is that they use everything that they get when they do business with other countries for the regime, they use it to reward the people in the ruling class, it never gets to the people...

198,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/18/cuba-protesters-warn-americans-who-like-che-guevara-fcking-terrorist/,"Protesters gathered outside of the White House on Thursday evening to urge President Joe Biden to act in support of the protests ongoing in Cuba this week told Breitbart News the mainstreaming of Castro regime mass murder Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara in America undermines the suffering of those he killed. Guevara, a wealthy Irish-Argentine communist who participated in Fidel Castros seizure of the island nation in 1959, presided over the organization of firing squads to eliminate people who disagreed with Castro and pioneered the use of concentration camps in Cuba. He wrote openly that he ""really loved to kill"" and particularly enjoyed killing religious people and suspected LGBT Cubans, but his legacy in the United States has somehow morphed into that of a ""revolutionary"" representing the downtrodden. A famous portrait of the killer has become a popular t-shirt in America and the West generally. A man identifying himself as Gianni, a Cuban protester at the White House, waved a Cuban flag emblazoned with an image rejecting Guevara. He told Breitbart News that those who admire Guevara have ""the wrong information"" and urged them to become better acquainted with his true legacy. ""People think he was great and a revolutionary. What no one tells you is that he used to kill gays in Cuba. His great idea was concentration camps for gays,"" Gianni explained. ""He used to kill Christians. He used to kill people that didnt agree with him just because they wanted freedom and they didnt want to be communist."" Guevara was responsible for helping Fidel Castro implement what were known as ""Military Units to Aid Production"" (UMAP), concentration camps nominally used for agricultural labor to enrich the country - already Latin Americas wealthiest in the immediate period prior to 1959 - but in reality used to kill and repress ""undesirable"" Cubans. Anyone suspected of homosexuality, known to belong to Christian groups like the Seventh-Day Adventists or Jehovahs Witnesses, dissident writers, journalists, and others seen as a threat to communism found themselves toiling in the UMAP. Reports indicate that overwork and intentionally dangerous situations created on the ground at the UMAPs were intended to kill their inmates. ""Fuck Che Guevara, he was a fucking terrorist,"" another man attending Thursdays protest who did not identify himself told Breitbart News. ""That man killed a lot of people, you know what Im saying? He killed a lot of motherfucking people. People in the world have a wrong impression of Che Guevara ... He was in charge of killing people in Cuba."" A third protester who identified himself as Amilkal told Breitbart News of Guevara, ""He said 'we are going to kill people and we will continue to kill people if we need it. People against the revolution, were going to kill them.'"" Amilkal appeared to be referencing a famous speech Guevara delivered before the United Nations General Assembly in 1964. ""We have to say here what is a well-known truth, that we have always expressed before the world: firing squad executions, yes, we have executed,"" Guevara told the world on that occasion. ""We execute and we will keep executing so long as it is necessary. Our struggle is a struggle to the death."" ""We know what the result of a lost battle would be and the maggots [anti-communists] must also know what the result of their lost battle is today in Cuba,"" Guevara continued. The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO celebrated Guevaras birthday - and this particular speech - with a public statement last month. The protesters organized outside of the White House on Thursday did so in solidarity with Cubans on the island who took the streets in dozens of cities across the county on Sunday and, reports indicate, continue to openly protest for freedom. The protests followed months of swelling unrest against communism, largely fueled by the discontent of young Cubans who have never known any other political system. The Castro regime responded to the protests by issuing an ""order of combat"" demanding that civilians take the streets and violently attack the protesters, despite the overwhelmingly peaceful nature of the protests on Sunday. The regime also shut down the internet, making it more difficult for protesters to share videos of either protests or of the subsequent repression and making reports of ongoing manifestations difficult to confirm from abroad. The White House protesters told Breitbart News repeatedly that the Biden administration should prioritize helping restore internet access for the average Cuban person and allowing Cubans in America to return to the island and help fight the regime. ""Were going to do it. If you dont want to do it, no military intervention, were going to do it,"" one protester told Breitbart News. The protesters also expressed panic regarding reports of police engaging in door-to-door raids, shooting and possibly killing unarmed protesters in their homes, in front of their families. At least one video smuggled out of the country this week showed police opening fire on a protester in his living room, in front of his toddler children and his wife. The mans health condition remains unknown at press time.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for their favorable stances on socialism. ""It doesnt work,"" Barbara, the daughter of Cuban refugees, told Breitbart News about communism. That is why ""we dont want it in this country, and that is why we are fighting. Its not a 'Cuban people problem. This is a problem for everyone in this country, for everyone that can easily be affected by communism. Latin America, South America, you do not want this."" She explained the reason her husband came to the United States from Cuba is because there are no basic rights on the island. Barbara said, being in the U.S., ""we take it for granted."" ""It scared me when you have people on the left, here, saying how perfect [communism] is. How you have the Bernie Sanders, AOCs try to implement those stupid laws like [they] have in [Cuba]; thats why were here,"" she said. ""You dont see Americans going to Cuba on a raft!"" ""I cant even believe were in a situation that were so close to communism in this country. Its sad. Its really, really sad. ... All these people around the world, its not just here in Washington; its not in Miami,"" she explained. ""The entire world is protesting. Somebody needs to wake up. Somebody needs to do something. Its too much, and nothings being done. And it needs to stop because its just like a cancer. It just grows and grows, and then [theres] no stopping it. And we need to stop communism now, and I think if we stop it now in this country, it will be a different world,"" Barbara said. Additionally, she said everyone should do their own research on Cuba and its bloody history since 1959, when Fidel Castro seized the island. She posed the question: ""If communism is so great, wouldnt it sustain itself?"" Saturdays White House protests also featured a ""die-in"" in which adults and children dressed in ""Young Pioneer"" uniforms -- the outfits reserved for children who excel at communist indoctrination classes in school -- and covered in blood lay on the ground to symbolize those under communist oppression. Some of the signs surrounding the ""die-in"" said, ""Youre sitting by while we die."" Another sign read, ""Cubas blood is on your hands.""",['Jacob Bliss'],7/18/2021 20:17,Cuba Protester: 'You Don't See Americans Going to Cuba on a Raft!',"['raft', 'stop', 'barbara', 'americans', 'communism', 'white', 'protester', 'cuban', 'world', 'cuba', 'dont', 'needs', 'country', 'going', 'somebody']","That is why ""we dont want it in this country, and that is why we are fighting.

MIAMI - For more than a week, protests in Miami-Dade County have taken over roads and neighborhoods. On Sunday it was at Tropical Park in Miami, where hundreds of people gathered with flags and lined the streets. It was a safe environment for children, many getting the opportunity to be a part of history and learning about Cuban history for the first time. It was also in Little Havana. Thats where the group Students for a Free Cuba organized a silent protest. Many held signs with the names and faces of people who disappeared in Cuba. More than 100 people have been arrested or are missing while protesting Cubas current regime. Rare protests on the communist-run island have the attention of Cuban-Americans across the world, including in Miami. Local college students want more young people to become educated on what is happening in Cuba. ""What we want to do is bring attention to the fact that people are being beaten on the streets, there are people bleeding out, women, children, youth, that shouldnt be happening anywhere,"" said Gabriella Gutierrez with Students for a Free Cuba.

201,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jeb-bush-appeals-to-biden-to-tear-down-cuba-cyberwall,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Jeb Bush, the former GOP presidential candidate, took to Twitter on Sunday to appeal to the Bide administration to employ the needed technology to restore internet service in Cuba amid the unrest that was sparked a week ago during anti-government protests. ""Technology exists to tear down Cubas cyberall (sp) and aid dissenters if President Biden is willing to use it,"" he posted. ""Please do so, President Biden."" Bush retweeted an editorial from the Wall Street Journal that pointed to Havanas attempt to stem protests by limiting internet access in certain areas of the country. The tactic is not a new one and has been used by other regimes facing unrest. The paper said the question really is not if the U.S. has the technology; the question is if the Biden administration has to political will to make such a move. ""Biden may be wary of upsetting the left and its romance with the Cuban regime, but the 2020 election showed thats a losing strategy in Florida,"" the paper said. Biden said Thursday that he is considering establishing an internet source for the Cuban people after the government shut off access amid mass protests. The Cuban government ended the internet shutdown Wednesday, allowing videos and images to surface that revealed suppressive efforts by police forces to quell the protests, but service has been unreliable. The White House did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News. In 2015, when he was considering a run for president, he was critical of the Obama administrations approach to Cuba. GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Ninety miles to our south, there is talk of a state visit by our outgoing president,"" he said, referring to President Obama. ""But we don't need a glorified tourist to go to Havana in support of a failed Cuba. We need an American president to go to Havana in solidarity with a free Cuban people, and I am ready to be that president.""

202,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/emboldened-by-protests-cuban-opposition-websites-pique-government-2021-07-19/,"People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini July 19 (Reuters) - Years before becoming president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel pushed for greater public access to the internet at a time when it was only available to a tiny minority. He would eventually succeed in getting much of his country online. Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miami's Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cuba's expanded internet access. The Cuban government has accused independent media outlets largely based in the Miami area of provoking the unprecedented, spontaneous protests that spread across Cuba a week ago. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register One of the sites it singled out, ADN Cuba, slants its coverage against the government in Havana at every turn. It recently published a photograph of Diaz-Canel that was altered to look like a police mugshot. ""Genocide,"" it said underneath. Its coverage of the protests has concentrated heavily on the people hurt or detained. For days, the site led with a story that the nephew of a senior Communist Party leader called on his family and the government to ""lay down your weapons"" and ""listen to the people."" Another headline reported protesters in eastern Cuba shouted ""murderer"" at Deputy Prime Minister Ramiro Valdes. Aiming for a young audience, Miami Beach-based Diario de Cuba closely follows Cuban and Cuban-American musicians critical of the government. One recent front page featured separate headlines on the latest news and views from musicians Pitbull, Lenier Mesa and Maykel Osorbo, while also reporting that Silvio Rodriguez, a longtime ally of Cuba's government, was trying to ""rescue"" artists who have abandoned the government. Around a dozen such Cuba-focused news and magazines have their websites blocked in Cuba, but Cubans can access them anyway using virtual private network (VPN) services, and share them on social media sites generally available in Cuba. Some relentlessly berate the government while others, though still critical, strive for more fact-based journalism like the pioneering outlet 14yMedio. The independent site El Toque, which also has a number of Cuba-based staff, published an article debunking false anti-government reports and out-of-context photos circulating on the internet that grossly inflated the size of the demonstrations. While it is difficult to measure the impact of the U.S.-based sites on recent protests in Cuba, the government there certainly sees them as a menace. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez dedicated much of a news conference last week to criticizing ADN Cuba and two journalists by name while also condemning a social media hashtag campaign boosted by bots. He accused opposition media of working for the U.S. government, which funds a number of Cuban opposition media websites with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, according to U.S. records published by the Cuba Money Project. Protesters in Cuba have also spread messages of discontent and word of protests on social media platforms, mostly Facebook, and encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. Many of those sites were blocked following the protests, prompting U.S. President Joe Biden to say he would review whether Washington could help Cubans regain internet access. Even without U.S. help, Cubans find ways to see censored content with circumvention tools such as Psiphon. The company says up to 1.4 million Cubans were using its application to see banned content on some days last week, up from 18,000 per day before the protests. read more That would mean 20% of Cuba's estimated 7 million internet users used that one tool to get around censors. 'IMPOSSIBLE DELUSION' In 2013, when he was heir apparent to former president Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel said that continuing to ban the internet in Cuba was an ""almost impossible delusion that doesn't make sense."" Internet access gradually expanded after that and the landscape changed dramatically in December 2018 when Cubans were able to get internet service on their mobile phones for the first time. Readership of opposition media inside Cuba exploded, said Baruch College professor Ted Henken, editor of the recently published book ""Cuba's Digital Revolution."" Henken talks to the media outlets, which track their traffic through Google Analytics and other methods. ""Since December 2018 these outlets have gained a huge island audience and left the official media even more exposed as propagandists,"" Henken said. ""They (the Cuban leadership) miscalculated in that they didn't realize that this would very quickly, in two and a half years, blow up in their face."" Rodriguez last week accused ADN Cuba and others of carrying out a plan for which ""U.S. imperialism has worked for a long time."" The U.S. government does provide financial assistance to media outlets critical of the Cuban government. A company closely associated with ADN Cuba received $410,710 from the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote human rights in Cuba last year, journalist Tracey Eaton reported via the Cuba Money Project, which tracks the spending through public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. USAID said in a statement that it, the U.S. State Department and the National Endowment for Democracy have been funding programs ""to increase the flow of information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba"" since 1996. ""USAID has helped train hundreds of journalists over the last decade to inform Cubans on the island. Their work has also appeared in major international news outlets,"" the statement said. ADN Cuba's founder did not respond to requests for comment. The two journalists named by Rodriguez declined interviews. Another anti-government website, CubaNet, received $300,000 from USAID in 2020, its director acknowledged. Once a biweekly newsletter printed in Miami, CubaNet now has a team in Cuba in defiance of the authorities, and has published stories on the apparent wealth of the Castro family. Director Hugo Landa said ""we have never hidden"" the U.S. funding and that U.S. officials have never tried to influence coverage. ""If we ever felt any pressure from any of our funders to influence our content, I would renounce that support,"" Landa said. With or without U.S. funding, the sites are trying to reach readers like Jorge Norris, a 35-year-old IT engineer in Cuba, who uses a VPN to read sites such as Diario de Cuba and 14yMedio along with official Cuban media. ""It's another view to be able to form an idea of what's happening in the world,"" Norris said. ""You have to be completely informed of what they say here in Cuba and in the world.""

Picture taken June 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, July 19 (Reuters) - Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, now has the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare protests that have roiled the Communist-run island. The Caribbean nation of 11 million people reported nearly 4,000 confirmed cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average and more than any other country in the Americas for its size. The outbreak, fueled by the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant first identified in India, has pushed hospitals at the virus epicenter in the province of Matanzas to the brink. State media has shown rare images of patients in beds in corridors and doctors complaining of a lack of oxygen, ventilators and medicines. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Cuba's handling of the pandemic was one of the issues that propelled thousands to take to the streets nationwide last Sunday in unprecedented anti-government demonstrations in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. read more Demonstrators also protested shortages of food and medicines and curbs on civil liberties. Cuba is not alone in struggling under new waves of the pandemic. But the political implications of such a crisis are greater in a country where healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of its ""revolutionary"" one-party system. Moreover the outbreak and subsequent lockdown and reduction in numbers of flights has taxed an already bankrupt economy where many work in tourism and others rely on travelers to bring in remittances and goods including medicine. ""The government has consistently made the case that one of the main accomplishments of the revolution is its world-class medical sector,"" said Cuban American historian Daniel Rodriguez, author of a book on medical politics in post-independence Havana. Rodriguez said the exacerbation of food and medicine shortages over the past year due to the pandemic-related economic crisis had already broken Cuba's social pact. ""When the pandemic began spiraling out of control a couple of weeks ago, it appeared increasingly the revolutionary government was no longer able to protect Cuban lives, and the result was an extraordinary repudiation of the revolution itself."" 'NOT EVEN MEDICINE' Cuba's government has blamed the demonstrations on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions tightened during the pandemic. Several countries and non-government organizations including Oxfam called on Washington to lift sanctions this week. On Saturday, authorities organized pro-government rallies across the island attended by thousands. But many Cubans have aimed their anger at their own government's handling of the economy and the pandemic. ""We are hungry, there's nothing at the moment, not even medicine,"" said Aylin Sardina, 33, at a protest in Havana. Some critics complained that the authorities appeared to have ample transport to deploy security forces to quell protests and bus state workers to rallies, while lacking ambulances. To be sure, Cuba has had some pandemic successes, notably the development of five vaccine candidates, two of which have proven to have efficacy of more than 90%,according to preliminary Cuban data. read more Thanks to one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita rates in the world, it was also able to send its ""white coat army"" to help other countries, and lately to reinforce hospitals in Matanzas. Moreover cumulative cases per capita are still below the global average, while deaths per capita, though rising, are still just a third of the global average, a fact Cuba credits to its experimental treatments and its free, universal healthcare. However, with cases now rising fast, a deepening of Cuba's economic crisis has prevented officials from imposing stricter lockdowns with many Cubans having to stand in lines for hours to get scarce goods. And so far only some two million people - less than a fifth of the population - are fully vaccinated. Brazil-based Cuban virologist Amilcar Perez Riverol said that premature triumphal statements from state media about the Cuban vaccine candidates and rallies like Saturday's may have also led to people lowering their guard, creating a breeding ground for cases to soar. The country has an ambitious aims to have fully vaccinated 70% of the population by September. But Perez Riverol warned that in the next few weeks COVID-19 deaths would likely continue to rise as they lagged the surge in cases. ""You go out onto the street to buy food and someone says to you: do you know who else died?"" said Libia Ortega, 44, a worker in a private cafeteria in Matanzas city closed due to the pandemic and shortages of products. ""The doctors are making a big effort to save lives every day but medicine and supplies are lacking.""

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - As protests calling for change in Cuba continue to occur throughout South Florida, especially in Miami-Dade County, the Cuban government has made an unprecedented announcement to allow donations to the island. The communist nation announced all plane passengers will be allowed to bring unlimited supplies of food, medicine, and hygiene products to the country between now and the end of the year. ""I actually spent the entire year of COVID there because I got stuck. So, I saw how bad it was, and its just been getting worse and worse,"" explained Vanessa Grau who is flying to Cuba with food and supplies. Grau lives in Miami, but has family on the island, including her husband. As soon as she heard about the change, she started a donation drive to collect extra food and medicine, which she brought on her flight to Havana, Monday morning. ""I just hope that it gets to go through -- I hope that what theyre saying is not a lie,"" she explained. ""I think that theyre kind of doing this to make people think, 'Oh, were good. Not really the truth, but, at least its allowing us to help some people there."" Ad The change comes more than a week after the historic uprisings in Cuba that sparked a week of solidarity protests all across South Florida. The latest protest occurred on Sunday, where nearly 100 people held a silent march through the streets of Little Havana hoping to call attention the plight of the people there on the island who are still in need of basic supplies. ""What we want to do is bring attention to the fact that people are being beaten on the streets. There are people bleeding out --women, children, youth, and that shouldnt be happening anywhere,"" explained Gabriella Gutierrez of Students for a Free Cuba. ""Just let people know that were behind them, that were going to continue fighting for freedom,"" added Grau. ""Because at the end of the day, the medicines help, but what we want at the end is freedom for all.""",['Trent Kelly'],7/19/2021 16:52,"Cuba allows plane passengers to bring food, medicine, and supplies until 2022","['passengers', 'end', 'food', 'change', '2022', 'explained', 'week', 'cuba', 'plane', 'unlimited', 'supplies', 'allows', 'medicine', 'worse', 'bring']","The communist nation announced all plane passengers will be allowed to bring unlimited supplies of food, medicine, and hygiene products to the country between now and the end of the year.

205,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/19/eastern-cuba-streets-death-regional-military-chief/,"Division General Agustin Pena, the commander of the Eastern Army of Cuba, died mysteriously on Saturday following rumors of Chinese coronavirus infection, leaving the military vulnerable amid nationwide protests against the ruling communist regime. Pena was 57 years old and, in addition to holding a pivotal military post, was a member of the Communist Partys central committee. The Communist Party did not disclose a cause of death or offer any indication of what preceded his passing. ""Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Sunday mourned the recent death of Division General Agustin Pena, chief of the Eastern Army, and sent his condolences to his family, friends and combatants,"" the Cuban state outlet Prensa Latina revealed on Sunday. ""On his official Twitter account, the president wrote that the news is very painful and sad."" No information suggests that Penas demise was directly related to the week-long protests throughout Cuba, which affected most of the regions Pena was in charge of the military in. Holguin, one of eastern Cubas largest cities and a command area under Pena, experienced some of the largest peaceful protests in the ongoing wave, which began on Sunday, July 11. In response to the protests, Diaz-Canel, the face of the Castro regime, ordered both the nations armed forces and civilians to violently attack anyone suspected of supporting anti-communist protests, resulting in significant violence in cities like Holguin. Some outlets have speculated that Pena died after being diagnosed with Chinese coronavirus, which has swept the nation in light of Communist Party mismanagement and the dilapidated state of its socialist healthcare system. The independent outlet 14 y Medio, whose journalists are based in Cuba, stated that multiple unnamed sources had relayed the information that Pena was at least suspected of suffering from the disease. ""Although official media have not offered information regarding Penas cause of death, Radio Rebelde journalist Aroldo Garcia Fombellida in Holguin wrote on his Facebook profile: 'he was liberated today ... against the mortal pandemic of Covid-19,'"" 14 y Medio reported. Cuba has documented 281,887 cases of Chinese coronavirus and nearly 2,000 deaths since the pandemic began, a number most experts believe is significantly lower than the true toll due to Cubas poor testing abilities and its history of fabricating medical statistics. As a member of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Cubas communist regime has close ties to its ideological allies in Beijing and has actively courted Chinese tourism. The regime also invited tourists from coronavirus hotspots like Italy at the height of the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020 while refusing to close schools or implement social distancing measures for Cuban citizens. Cubanet, another independent outlet reliant on journalists on the island, reported that widespread protests continued in at least two eastern cities, Guantanamo and Baracoa, on Saturday. Authorities arrested two Cubanet journalists last weekend for attempting to cover the first wave of protests. The Castro regime shut off access to the internet for nearly all citizens in Cuba following July 11, severely limiting the information - and images - the international media are now privy to regarding the situation on the ground in the country. Cubanet reported that ""political police,"" special forces reserved for repressing dissidents, took over Baracoa after protests began, but that the heavy law enforcement presence has not limited public displays of support for an end to the regime. Videos of protests in Baracoa, dated Saturday, July 17, surfaced on social media this weekend, showing large crowds of peaceful protesters marching in the streets. The videos appear to be taken on mobile phones by anonymous sources however, and Breitbart News could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos: Much of Cuba appears to be in a state of de facto martial law following the start of the protests, multiple Cuban interest news outlets have reported. The Spain-based Diario de Cuba newspaper reported on Sunday that San Antonio de los Banos, the city where protests are believed to have first begun last week, is flooded with ""trucks full of soldiers and the central plaza in the town has been seized by dozens of police, soldiers, and State Security agents."" The city also lacks any access to the internet, locals have denounced, with no indication of when Cubas state-run telecommunications company ETECSA will restore access. The nationwide protests resulted in an unknown number of arrests and enforced disappearances nationwide, at one point last week estimated to be as high a 5,000 people. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH) has confirmed as of Saturday 560 arrests and/or disappearances, many of them people who witnesses can confirm were taken into police custody or into hospitals after police attacks but whose family has no knowledge of their whereabouts. Many of those documented as missing or arrested are prominent members of the dissident community who already have ties to foreign groups like the OCDH; experts believe many of the arrested or disappeared could be in remote areas of the country, with no civil society infrastructure to seek to account for their wellbeing.

206,https://nypost.com/2021/07/19/could-balloons-power-uncensored-internet-in-cuba/,"Floridas Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, called this week on the administration of President Joe Biden to greenlight a plan to transmit the internet to people in Cuba via high-altitude balloons when their government has blocked access. Can internet be delivered by balloon? Yes. For years, Alphabet -- the parent company of Google -- worked to perfect an internet-balloon division service called Loon. It shut down that project in January, saying it wasnt commercially viable. Prior to the shutdown, Loon balloons had been providing service in mountainous areas in Kenya through a partnership with a local telecom, Telkom Kenya. The service also helped provide wireless communications in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which destroyed the islands mobile network. Loon partnered with AT&T to make service available. How does that work? The Loon balloons were effectively cell towers the size of a tennis court. They floated 60,000 to 75,000 feet, or 11 to 14 miles, above the Earth, well above commercial jetliner routes. Made of the commonplace plastic polyethylene, the balloons used solar panels for electricity and could deliver service to smartphones in partnership with a local telecom. Each balloon could serve thousands of people, the company said. But they had to be replaced every five months or so because of the harsh conditions in the stratosphere. And the balloons could be difficult to control. ""Navigating balloons through the stratosphere has always been hard,"" wrote Salvatore Candido, who had been chief technology officer for Loon, in a December 2020 blog post. The company created algorithms that tracked wind patterns. What equipment was required? Loon had said that beyond the balloons themselves, it needed network integration with a telecom to provide service and some equipment on the ground in the region. It also needed permission from local regulators -- something that the Cuban government isnt likely to grant. Could a network be set up from afar? Yes. Loon used multiple balloons to extend connections beyond the necessary ground link. In one 2018 test, Loon said the connection jumped 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, over 7 balloons. Another time, it bridged a wireless connection over 600 kilometers, or about 370 miles, between two balloons. Cuba and Florida are only about 100 miles apart at their closest. Is the feasible? But experts arent sure it would be that easy to set up a guerrilla internet service for Cuba this way. It would need an unused band of spectrum, or radio frequencies, to transmit a connection to Cuba and spectrum use is typically controlled by national governments. Anyone trying this would have to find a free block of spectrum that wouldnt be interfered with, said Jacob Sharony, of Mobius Consulting, a mobile and wireless consulting firm. Balloon- or drone-powered networks arent likely to be economical over the long term, said Tim Farrar of TMF Associates, a satellite communications consultant. While theyre suitable for bridging communications amid disasters or in war zones, the transmission capabilities of such networks isnt large -- ""certainly not enough to serve the entire population of Cuba or anything like that,"" Farrar said. Another challenge: The Cuban government could also try to jam the signal. Who is involved in the Cuba effort? DeSantis promoted the balloon idea Thursday alongside two Cuban-American members of Congress from the Miami area, Reps. Maria Salazar and Carlos Gimenez, FCC commissioner Brendan Carr and Cuban-American lawyer, businessman and museum director Marcell Felipe. Felipe said he has been talking for about two years with a defense contractor who could deploy such balloons in a cost-effective way in airspace near Cuba, but declined to name the company. Felipe said his idea would involve transmitting internet connectivity directly to mobile phones on the island without the participation of any ground provider. In comments to The Associated Press, Felipe claimed it wouldnt be feasible for the Cuban government to block these balloon-delivered signals ""in any significant manner,'' though he didnt cite any evidence. None of the supporters provided a cost estimate. Salazar said that if the federal government endorsed the plan, she believes it could be funded entirely with contributions from members of the Cuban diaspora if necessary. What is internet access like in Cuba? Internet access in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. Starting in December 2018, Cubans could get internet access on their phones through the state telecom monopoly. More than half of Cubans today have internet access. But the Cuban government restricts independent media and censors whats available to Cubans online, according to Human Rights Watch. It disrupts internet access in an attempt to head off protests.",[],7/19/2021 17:08,Could balloons power uncensored internet in Cuba?,"['access', 'power', 'uncensored', 'cuban', 'internet', 'company', 'cuba', 'balloons', 'miles', 'loon', 'wireless', 'service']","The Loon balloons were effectively cell towers the size of a tennis court.

President Biden is considering augmenting staffing levels at the U.S. embassy in Havana and forming a group to deliver remittances to the Cuban people, a senior administration official told FOX News on Monday. ""On July 11, the world watched as tens of thousands of Cuban citizens marched through Havana and cities across Cuba bravely asserting their fundamental and universal rights and demanding freedom and relief from the oppression of Cubas authoritarian regime,"" the senior administration official said. ""The Biden-Harris administration has and will continue to stand with the Cuban people."" The president is directing the government to actively pursue measures to support the Cuban people and hold the regime in power responsible, the official said. Republicans have repeatedly accused the Biden administration of doing too little to help the Cuban people confront the communist dictatorship. MARION SMITH: MARXIST BLACK LIVES MATTER - HERE'S WHY IT SUPPORTS CUBA'S COMMUNISTS OVER THE PROTESTERS In addition to asking the State Department to review staffing levels at the embassy as a means to facilitate diplomatic and civil engagement, the administration is looking into ways to engage the private sector to make the internet more widely available to the countrys residents. It is also looking at ways to increase humanitarian assistance to Cuba and will continue to designate Cuban officials responsible for violent repression and human rights violations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this month the Cuban people carried out the most widespread protests the country has seen in decades over food and medicine shortages, as well as power outages. The protests turned violent as participants clashed with the police. Over the weekend, President Miguel Diaz-Canel gathered supporters in the streets and delivered a speech where he partly blamed the U.S. embargo for the unrest.

208,https://www.foxnews.com/media/rubio-russia-cuba-regime-lost-legitimacy,"Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warned that Russian assets are already in Cuba and have been for some time, further declaring that the heir to the Castro brothers' communist dictatorship has lost its legitimacy to govern. The Cuban communist regime, currently headed by President Miguel Diaz-Canel, has lost that legitimacy, the senator told ""Special Report"" on Monday. Earlier this month, pro-democracy protesters took to the streets across the island nation--in defiance of the ruthless regime's stranglehold on public demonstrations--to call for human rights and basic necessities. As tensions boiled over in Havana, Cuban refugees, expatriates and their families came out in a massive show of solidarity with the Cuban people in demonstrations across the Sunshine state. ""Cuba today is basically in a state of martial law and in many of the major cities across the country, troops are stationed--security forces are stationed--and the message is clear. They are also continuing to repress people,"" Rubio said, adding that in the wake of Diaz-Canel shutting down civilians' internet access, reports are still coming out of the country of torture and ""abductions"" of Cuban citizens by the government. ""This the is model [the regime in Havana has] followed a long time. The only difference between now and the past some of it is being documented and posted on social media for the world to see,"" he said. Rubio went on to warn that Cuba's ally Russia is essentially on-call for the Diaz-Canel regime, and could set up a very tenuous situation for Florida and the United States, should Kremlin resources amass just 90 miles offshore. ""Russia is already there. They have an intelligence station and so do the Chinese,"" Rubio warned. ""It's the model they follow everywhere in the world. It may not eve be directly Russian troops [but] private contractors that are basically Russian troops that they send around the world."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""But this is what they have done in place after place--in Venezuela and Syria and eastern Ukraine and so there is no doubt in my mind that if the Cuba government requests it, the Russian will provide that."" Rubio underlined that that fact should be top of mind for President Biden. ""This is a bloodbath 90 miles off of our shores. It's destabilizing. I want to know what Joe Biden is going to do when 1,000 special forces from Russia arrive on Cuban territory to help the Cuba regime. That's what's coming next,"" Rubio said.",['Charles Creitz'],7/19/2021 20:54,"Rubio: 'Russia is already' in Cuba, the Diaz-Canel regime 'lost its legitimacy to govern'","['special', 'rubio', 'govern', 'russian', 'cuban', 'regime', 'world', 'russia', 'cuba', 'warned', 'lost', 'diazcanel', 'legitimacy', 'troops']","Sen.

209,https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2021/07/19/sos-cuba-movement-is-golden-political-opportunity-for-biden-experts-say/,"MIAMI - When young Cuban-American protesters showed up at the SOS Cuba protests in Miami-Dade County last week, Fernand Amandi saw a ""golden"" opportunity for U.S. President Joe Biden and his Democratic party. The Cuban-American Democratic pollster and other experts have said Biden shouldnt underestimate the generational political rewards of truly backing the SOS Cuba movement. ""I think this is a historical moment that deserves more than statements,"" said Amandi, of Bendixen & Amandi International. ""It requires presidential engagement."" SOS Cuba protesters attend a march and rally on July 15 in Hialeah. After the July 11 uprising in the communist island, SOS Cuba supporters asked Biden for U.S. military intervention. There were marches, and rallies in Hialeah, Little Havana, Miami Springs, Westchester, Kendall, and other areas of Miami-Dade. The protests also included the illegal blocking of the Palmetto Expressway. Cuban Americans said they werent asking for humanitarian aid; they want communism to end. Ad ""I think this is a golden political opportunity that has fallen into the lap of a Democratic president to do what 12 previous U.S. presidents, Republicans, and Democrats alike, have not been able to do and thats to preside over the liberation of Cuba,"" Amandi said. SOS Cuba protesters march from Versailles to the Freedom Tower on July 14, in Miami. Sen. Marco Rubio has asked Biden to not change former President Donald Trumps travel restrictions and to keep Cuba on the list of state sponsors of terrorism again. Rubio and Gov. Ron DeSantis also asked Biden to help Cubans with improving internet connectivity. Biden has agreed to look into this. Brian Fonseca, the director of Florida International Universitys Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy, believes whatever Biden does may not be enough. ""Unless it provokes a change on the island, then the Democrats are going to look like the losers here because they were unable to affect change in Cuba,"" Fonseca said.

Ramon Saul Sanchez, the president of the Democracy Movement in Miami, said Biden hasnt responded to the demands of the SOS Cuba movement with urgency. Ad ""Every minute we lose is a minute that the government has to repress the Cuban people,"" Sanchez said. As SOS Cuba appears to be the beginning of a new movement, a stand against communism also has the potential to end the association between the Democratic party and socialism. 4:30 p.m. report Complete coverage in Spanish","['Hatzel Vela', 'Andrea Torres']",7/19/2021 22:40,"SOS Cuba movement is 'golden' political opportunity for Biden, experts say","['say', 'president', 'sos', 'experts', 'biden', 'golden', 'miamidade', 'democratic', 'cuba', 'movement', 'political', 'opportunity', 'amandi', 'miami', 'protesters']","The Cuban-American Democratic pollster and other experts have said Biden shouldnt underestimate the generational political rewards of truly backing the SOS Cuba movement.

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - The United States is expected to soon announce initial steps as part of the Biden administrations review of Cuba policy and in response to Havana's crackdown on the biggest street protests in decades, State Department officials said on Monday. The senior officials comments further signaled that President Joe Biden was not ready to soften the U.S. approach after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era detente with Havana, and that the latest Cuban unrest would have a significant impact on any policy moves. The officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, also made clear that the Biden administration is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people while keeping pressure on the Communist-led government in Havana. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Biden said last week he was not prepared to loosen restrictions for now on remittances, or payments that Americans can make to their families on the island, because of concern that the Cuban government would seize a large part of the funds. But Washington is looking closely at crafting a possible work-around to restore the flow of remittances, which were shut down under Trump, in a way that does not put money in the hands of the Cuban government, one of the State Department officials said. The official declined to elaborate but suggested it would take time to develop such a mechanism, saying: ""I wouldn't anticipate a short-term loosening."" Thousands of Cubans staged spontaneous anti-government protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Scores of activists were detained. loading The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. 'A TOP PRIORITY' The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency in the Cuba policy review, which began shortly after Biden took office in January but until now had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad. ""There will definitely be policy implications as a result of the events over the course of the last week. ... I'd expect in fairly short order there will be a senior U.S. government communication as to initial steps,"" one official said while declining to provide specifics. Cuba, the official said, is now a ""top priority."" ""It's a historic moment in Cuba given that the protesters showed up to more than 58 locations throughout the island numbering tens of thousands, making demands of their government for change,"" the official said. Under consideration as part of the review - even before the protests occurred - is whether to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" a label Trump gave to Havana just days before leaving office. But the State Department official said there was no timeline for a decision on the issue. Also figuring into the over-arching Cuba policy review is Cubas continued support for Venezuelas Socialist president, Nicolas Maduro, whose government is also under sanction by the United States, the State Department official said. Maduro has retained power with the support not only of his military and Cuban allies but of Russia, China and Iran. Biden, a Democrat, had vowed during his presidential campaign to ease some of the sanctions on Cuba tightened by Trump, a Republican. But analysts say the protests have complicated Bidens political leeway to do so, especially after he made a poorer-than-expected showing with voters in south Floridas anti-communist Cuban-American community, which backed Trumps tough policies toward Havana and Caracas and helped him win the battleground state. Many analysts say Biden may have to tread carefully on Cuba policy ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.

He also ordered a review of the viability of increasing staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The White House is hopeful that a boost in staffing could help it better facilitate civil society engagement following one of the communist islands biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory. The actions were detailed by a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Biden administration hadnt yet publicly announced the effort. It comes a little more than a week after thousands of Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island to protest food shortages and high prices during the coronavirus crisis. Its a level of frustration not seen in Cuba in more than 60 years. ADVERTISEMENT Biden is also calling for the administration to work with Congress to identify options to make the internet more accessible on the island. The regime moved to quickly cut off internet access to stop images of the protests from being broadcast to the world. Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, have been urging Biden to make free satellite internet access available to dissidents to help them subvert the Cuban governments effort to stop activists from getting their messages on social media. The administration will also look to work with international organizations to increase humanitarian assistance, while the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control will explore sanctioning Cuban officials who committed human rights violations against peaceful protesters in Cuba, the official said. Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond and Juan Gonzalez, a senior National Security Council official, met on Monday with Cuban American leaders to hear their policy recommendations and concerns in the aftermath of the demonstrations, according to the White House. Biden, who has been under congressional pressure to take action, last week called Cuba a ""failed state"" that was ""repressing their citizens."" But Biden also suggested that taking effective action was complicated. ""There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government,"" Biden said. ""For example, the ability to send remittances back to Cuba. We would not do that now because the fact is its highly likely the regime would confiscate those remittances or big chunks of it."" A dramatic drawdown of embassy personnel from Cuba began in 2017, unrelated to the Trump administrations antipathy towards President Barack Obamas rapprochement with the island . Instead, the removal of staffers from the U.S. Embassy in Havana began in the spring and summer of that year in response to unexplained brain injuries suffered by American diplomats, spies and other government employees posted to the island. The Trump administration also moved to reverse many of the Obama administration's initiatives, reimposing restrictions that had barred direct commercial flights by U.S. carriers to multiple Cuban airports and port calls by U.S. registered cruise ships. As president Donald Trump also sharply curtailed remittances that Cuban Americans were allowed to send to relatives on the island, barred financial and commercial transactions with most Cuban companies affiliated with the government or military and, in his final days in office, redesignated Cuba a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" in part for its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Biden said as a presidential candidate that he would revert to Obama-era policies that loosened decades of embargo restrictions on Havana, and the political right in the U.S. has accused him of not being supportive enough of Cuban dissidents. Thus far, the Biden administration has said its reviewing its Cuba policy and has done little to move away from Trumps posture toward the communist regime. Some of the more liberal members of the Democratic Party, most notably Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have criticized the Cuban government but also called on Biden to lift the embargo and argued that the embargo policy is contributing to Cuban suffering.","['Aamer Madhani', 'Matthew Lee']",7/19/2021 23:24,AP source: Biden looks to increase staffing of Cuba embassy,"['havana', 'staffing', 'source', 'increase', 'president', 'policy', 'embassy', 'white', 'biden', 'communist', 'cuban', 'ap', 'cuba', 'administration', 'island', 'looks']","(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)Demonstrators shout their solidarity with the Cuban people against the communist government during a rally outside the White House in Washington, Saturday, July 17, 2021.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - President Joe Biden talked about the economy and jobs on Monday from the White House while also addressing the historic protests in Washington, D.C., in support for the people of Cuba. He said he did hear South Floridians call for help, many of them showing up in the capital Saturday. There was plenty on the agenda Monday. Lawmakers continued to debate spending $4 trillion on Bidens infrastructure plan. Meanwhile, the president said that Tuesday will mark six months since his administration began. He touted that the U.S. went from creating 60,000 jobs per month to 60,000 jobs in three days. He spoke about the nations economic recovery amid the pandemic and the need for everyone to get the vaccine against the coronavirus. ""This virus doesnt have to hold you back any longer, it doesnt have to hold our economy back any longer,"" he said. He also added that investing in his infrastructure proposal would help the U.S. economy bounce back. And addressed concerns that his sweeping economic agenda will serve as an accelerant to inflation. Ad ""Weve seen some price increases. Some folks have raised worry that this could be a sign of persistent inflation, but thats not our view,"" Biden said. The president said experts and data show that price increases were expected and will be temporary. All of this as just outside the White House protests continued for the people of Cuba. We asked White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki if the president heard the people who made the 15-hour trek from Miami and throughout South Florida to Washington, D.C., over the weekend. ""The president has absolutely heard their call for help,"" Psaki said. ""He is engaged closely with his national security team, his administration team to think about the best ways we can help the people of Cuba."" And Psaki says the White House is now looking to see if they can offer humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba and possibly help get the internet back on as they have an ongoing review of their policies when it comes to Cuba.","['Ben Kennedy', 'Michelle Solomon']",7/20/2021 0:58,"Biden's 'heard call for help' from South Floridians to assist in Cuba, press secretary says","['dc', 'psaki', 'heard', 'south', 'president', 'jobs', 'white', 'biden', 'floridians', 'help', 'cuba', 'house', 'press', 'secretary', 'bidens', 'washington', 'economy', 'assist']","WASHINGTON, D.C. - President Joe Biden talked about the economy and jobs on Monday from the White House while also addressing the historic protests in Washington, D.C., in support for the people of Cuba.

""No matter what problem there is in the world, Americas to blame for it. Americas done something wrong. They dont know what the heck theyre talking about,"" he added. After protesters calling for the overthrow of Cubas Communist regime took to the streets of Havana and other cities on July 11, Sanders tweeted that the embargo, which has been in place since 1962, had ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" Ocasio-Cortez remained silent until Thursday, when she issued a statement expressing ""solidarity"" with the Cuban people and condemning repression by the Havana government. She then turned her focus to the embargo, describing it as ""absurdly cruel"" and ""the US contribution to Cuban suffering."" ""It is never acceptable for us to use cruelty as a point of leverage against every day [sic] people,"" she said. Senator Bernie Sanders said the US embargo has ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" EPA ""Theres only two embargoes here,"" Rubio said Monday. ""The embargo against government-owned companies, and the embargo that the Cuban regime imposes on its own people. ""Right now, if an independent business operator, if a small farm owner, if a consultant or independent contractor in Cuba wants to do business with Americans, they can,"" the senator explained. ""Theres no [US government] restriction on that. Its the Cuban regime that doesnt allow it ... because they want to control how much money people make every month. Its the leverage they hold over their heads. The people who give these opinions dont know what theyre talking about."" The Associated Press reported late Monday that President Biden had ordered the State Department to look at increasing staff levels at the US Embassy in Havana in order to help boost engagement with ordinary Cubans following the protests. Biden also reportedly ordered the creation of a working group to review US remittance policy to ensure that money that Cuban-Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. Rubio and other lawmakers have been urging the White House to work with Congress to help make the internet more accessible on the island after the Cuban government blocked social media sites during the protests. ""Cuba today is basically in a state of martial law,"" Rubio told host Bret Baier. ""In many of the major cities across the country, troops are stationed, security forces are stationed, and the message is clear: Theyre all continuing to repress people."" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the Cuban governments repression and the US embargo. Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA He added: ""These horrifying reports weve seen and have gotten -- of people being tortured, of people being abducted from their homes and family members not knowing where they are -- this is the model they have followed for a long time. The only difference between now and in the past is some of it is being documented and posted on social media for the world to see."" ""What is clear now,"" the senator said, ""is that the rupture between the people and the regime is complete, and that theyve lost their legitimacy to govern, and thats the point that needs to continue to be driven home.""",['Social Links For Samuel Chamberlain'],7/20/2021 5:04,"Rubio blasts calls from AOC, Sanders to lift US embargo on Cuba","['theyre', 'embargo', 'lift', 'rubio', 'blasts', 'cuban', 'regime', 'sanders', 'aoc', 'cuba', 'talking', 'calls', 'point', 'know', 'americas']","They dont know what the heck theyre talking about,"" he added.

""On July 11, the world watched as tens of thousands of Cuban citizens marched through Havana and cities across Cuba bravely asserting their fundamental and universal rights and demanding freedom and relief from the oppression of Cubas authoritarian regime,"" a senior administration official told Fox News. ""The Biden-Harris administration has and will continue to stand with the Cuban people,"" the official said. The official said the president is directing his administration to  reach out in support of the Cuban people and hold the Communist regime responsible.  Biden has  asked the State Department to review staffing levels at the embassy to ensure there are enough personnel to carry out the diplomatic work and outreach to the people, and the administration is trying to find ways to work with the private sector to increase internet access in Cuba after the Communist government shut down digital communications. President  Biden has  asked the State Department to review staffing levels at the embassy. AFP via Getty Images  Also part of the ramped-up efforts, Biden is considering ways to increase humanitarian assistance and will continue identifying Cuban officials responsible for human rights violations.  Bidens moves come after he  was roundly criticized for his lukewarm response to the anti-government demonstrations nearly two weeks ago. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is of Cuban descent, slammed the White House for initially saying that Cubans were protesting the governments ""mismanagement.""

216,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/20/with-hundreds-missing-mothers-cuban-protesters-plan-march-justice/,"The mothers of protesters missing since anti-communist marches erupted nationwide in Cuba on July 11 are planning to take the streets of the island on Wednesday demanding to know what the regime did to their children. The protest is expected to be the largest national anti-communist event within Cuba since the July 11 protests. International news outlets have struggled to document the ongoing protests since July 11 as the Castro regime shut down internet access nationwide following a rapid deluge of videos of police using live ammunition against unarmed protesters began to surface from the country. Assembly of the Cuban Resistance The Movement of July 11 Mothers, a newly formed support group, is reportedly organizing large-scale demonstrations against the regimes treatment of their children, who they assert are legitimate protesters and not ""delinquents"" as the communist authorities have described them, the independent outlet Cubanet - which had several of its journalists arrested over the past two weeks - reported. The group takes its name from the start date of the latest round of anti-communist protests on the island. The mothers aim to turn out large crowds in every Cuban province and to parade through Havana, beginning at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday. The group further advises local gatherings to take precautions against spreading the Chinese coronavirus, which has ravaged Cuba due to the regimes invitation of European tourists at the height of the first wave of the pandemic and its refusal to implement safety protocols in schools and at food ration lines. Eight days into the protests, the number of protesters wounded, arrested, killed, or disappeared remains unknown. Some human rights groups have compiled lists of individuals confirmed arrested or missing, with the caveat that many of those repressed may not have access to anyone in the outside world that could report their fate. At least 5,000 people had been arrested by July 14, three days into the protests, according to the independent Cuban news source 14 y Medio. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), a human rights group, managed to confirm at least 560 victims of this practice as of Saturday, listing them by name. Prominent dissidents, such as Jose Daniel Ferrer and artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom the regime has routinely jailed over the years, rank among the arrested, 14 y Medio noted. 14 y Medio noted the absence of any official figures and highlighted the range of estimates from human rights organizations, which assert the regimes victims number in the ""thousands."" The United Nations, in contrast, has identified at least 187 disappeared demonstrators. The lower figures represent only confirmed victims of the regime. Many more Cuban parents know nothing of their loved ones whereabouts or vital status. The government imposed an Internet blackout shortly after the initial outbreak of dissent and has actively suppressed information from reaching international audiences. Authorities have also violently attacked outside journalists for documenting the protests. Communist authorities last week brutally assaulted Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa, leaving him bloody. Beginning on July 11, thousands of Cubans took to the streets of San Antonio de los Banos unequivocally demanding an end to communism on the island. The protests quickly spread to every major city and shouts of ""Down with communism!"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" quickly became bywords of the movement. In response, ""President"" Miguel Diaz-Canel, the Castro regimes figurehead, called for Havana loyalists to take to the streets and attack the peaceful dissidents, issuing an ""order of combat"" during a bellicose speech on July 11. The subsequent crackdown saw police unleash live rounds on demonstrators in many instances, while other violent reprisals involved gruesome police beatings or the turning of attack dogs on the crowds. Cuban Prisoners Defenders, a human rights group advocating for the Castro regimes incarcerated dissidents, documented the crackdowns brutality and the regimes many crimes against the Cuban people in a Monday letter to the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, ADN Cuba reported. Civilian support for the Cuban people has exploded in the United States, especially in Florida, which boasts a large population of Cuban expats and their children. Large crowds turned out in Miami almost immediately after the protests began to express solidarity with the anti-communists on the island. On Saturday, protesters demanding action from Biden administration staged a ""die-in"" outside the White House during which they dressed in bloodstained communist school uniforms and played dead to represent Havanas countless victims. The responses from President Joe Biden and his administration, however, have ranged from apathetic to counterproductive. A day after the protests began, Washington announced it would lift sanctions against the socialist dictatorship in Venezuela, a de facto colony of communist Cuba that provides the Castro government with essentially free energy. On Monday, Biden held a Zoom call with several Cuban-American celebrities.",['Ben Whedon'],7/20/2021 14:59,Mothers of Cuban Protesters Plan Marches in Support of Their Missing Children,"['marches', 'rights', 'missing', 'mothers', 'children', 'support', 'cuban', 'group', 'protests', 'cuba', '11', 'regimes', 'plan', 'human', 'arrested', 'protesters']","The mothers of protesters missing since anti-communist marches erupted nationwide in Cuba on July 11 are planning to take the streets of the island on Wednesday demanding to know what the regime did to their children.

The call was hosted by the Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement Cedric Richmond and an administration national security advisor for the region. CBS Miami reporter Jim DeFede revealed, citing a White House press release, that the call included celebrity musician Gloria Estefan; her husband, producer Emilio Estefan; and actor Andy Garcia. The rest of the list included business leaders, lobbyists, and a playwright. DeFede named only one Cuban religious leader, Father Fernando Heria, on the list. Notable omissions include all Cuban-American senators, former political prisoners residing in the United States, and leaders of humanitarian and human rights groups specializing in Cuban issues in Florida. The White House just released a ""readout"" on a ""listening session"" with Cuban American leaders. The WH did not identify who was part of the ZOOM meeting but @CBSMiami has learned the names include Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Andy Garcia, Luis Lauredo, and Carlos Saladrigas. 1/x pic.twitter.com/weJrIEBfhO -- Jim DeFede (@DeFede) July 20, 2021 The White House issued a readout of the call to reporters noting that the officials ""underscored that the White House is monitoring the situation in Cuba closely and that addressing the moment and ongoing situation in Cuba is a top priority for the Administration."" Gloria Estefan expressed her support for the Cuban protesters on Thursday on Instagram, calling for the United States to condemn the violence from the Cuban government in response to overwhelmingly peaceful protests against the regime in dozens of cities. ""The United Nations &, very especially, the United States, must strongly condemn the repressive & violent measures being taken by the Cuban government against their own people! Spread the images, spread the word!"" she wrote. President Biden has faced pressure from the Cuban exile community to act in support of the people of Cuba, who are largely impoverished and unarmed save for rocks thrown in response to Cuban State Security officials opening fire on crowds of protesters. The Cuban Communist Party has ordered violent suppressions of recent protests and shut down the internet to stifle organization from the opposition. The Biden administration has struggled when addressing the widespread protests, falsely claiming they were in protest of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. After several days of criticism for his lackluster response to the protests, Biden publicly stated Thursday that communism was a ""failed system"" and that Cuba was ""repressing"" its citizens, but has yet to take any action.",['Charlie Spiering'],7/20/2021 15:06,Joe Biden's Cuba Plan: A Zoom Call with Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia,"['garcia', 'gloria', 'estefan', 'white', 'biden', 'zoom', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'plan', 'bidens', 'andy', 'united', 'joe', 'defede', 'response']","The White House announced Monday President Joe Biden held a Zoom video conference call with Cuban-American celebrities in an attempt to organize a policy in response to nationwide anti-communist protests on the island.

218,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scalise-slams-biden-disgusting-message-cubans,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., blasted the Biden adminstration Tuesday for telling Cubans seeking freedom not to come to the United States, while allowing thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. through the southern border. ""Think about what a disgusting message that was by the Biden administration to tell people from Cuba not to come here when they've opened up the southern border,"" said GOP Whip Scalise, noting some people on the terrorist watch list have tried to cross into the United States by way of the Mexican border. MAYORKAS SAYS MIGRANTS FLEEING CUBA, HAITI BY SEA WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER US Scalise's comments to reporters at the Capitol Tuesday come after Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said last week that those fleeing Cuba or Haiti by sea would not be allowed into the U.S. - and would either be returned or, if they were found to have a fear of persecution, referred to a third country. ""The time is never right to attempt migration by sea,"" Mayorkas said at a press conference. ""To those who risk their lives doing so, this risk is not worth taking."" ""Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" he added. Both countries have been hit by political unrest. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated and the country, which was suffered instability and insecurity for years, has reached out to the U.S. for military assistance. And Cuba has been rocked by protests against the authoritarian communist regime over high prices, medical shortages and other economic conditions. TWO ASYLUM POLICIES? CUBANS ARRIVING BY BOAT TURNED BACK BUT THOSE CROSSING SOUTHWEST BORDER FACE BETTER ODDS Meanwhile, the southern border has been inundated with a flood of migrants seeking asylum in the United States, with many not being turned away, but rather processed and given immigration court dates and released into the interior of the United States. In June alone, there were nearly 190,000 migrant encounters at the southern border, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Friday -- yet another rise in what were already sky-high border numbers, and bringing the total number of encounters in fiscal year (FY) 2021 to more than 1 million. While most adults and some migrant family units are being turned away, many migrant families are not being expelled, and neither are unaccompanied children. Scalise said Biden ""needs to get his priorities straight"" and help the Cuban people trying to seek freedom.

219,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/with-increasing-defiance-cuban-churches-urge-government-listen-not-repress-2021-07-20/,"HAVANA, July 20 (Reuters) - Cuba's churches have defended those who participated in unprecedented protests and even set up a hotline to advise the families of detainees, a sign of increasing boldness from spiritual leaders on the Communist-run island. Protests erupted nationwide on July 11 against shortages of medicine and food, power outages, the COVID-19 surge and curbs on freedom. The government blamed counter-revolutionaries it said were exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions. Hundreds of protesters, activists and journalists have since been detained, according to human rights groups. Authorities say they are prosecuting those who instigated ""unpatriotic unrest"" and committed vandalism. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register In the days following the protests, the dominant Roman Catholic church, other religions, and freemasons issued statements in favor of free expression. After decades of repression following the 1959 revolution, an expansion of religious freedoms in the 1990s has given religious groups greater autonomy than any other organization not affiliated with the Communist Party. But such candor is still rare in Cuba, where significant restrictions on dissent remain in place. ""Amid the difficulties, the protests of recent days and also the detentions, the repression, the Church wants to pray for all Cubans, for all Cuba,"" Dionisio Garcia, Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, the country's second largest city, said in a televised mass on Sunday. The Cuban people need changes to feel hope, he said at the Church of the Virgin of Charity of El Cobre, the patron saint of a country where an estimated 60% are baptized Catholics. Protestant denominations also backed the protesters' right to express themselves, with the Methodist Church stating in a post shared on social media on Saturday: ""The fact of disagreeing with the political system does not turn a person into an antisocial element or criminal."" All urged both protesters and authorities to avoid violence in favor of dialogue. The conference of Catholic bishops expressed concern the government's response would instead be ""immobility"" and even a ""hardening of positions."" The Catholic Church in particular has played an important role in Cuban society in recent years, negotiating the release of political prisoners and fomenting the 2014 detente with old Cold War foe the United States. But government critics have at times accused the Church of not doing enough to confront authorities over human rights, in favor of a fragile entente that allows them a seat at the table of power. That may be changing. In his weekly address to the faithful in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff, said he felt close to those families in Cuba suffering the most in these ""difficult moments"". ""I pray that the Lord might help the nation construct a society that is more and more just and fraternal through peace, dialogue and solidarity,"" he said. The Cuban Conference of Catholic Religious opened a helpline for those detained and their relatives on Sunday. ""This is focused on providing counsel for the presentation of habeas corpus, help in locating the detainees, and spiritual and psychological guidance for the relatives,"" it said. Meanwhile, Cuba's Grand Lodge of Freemasons - a secretive society that also has a broad reach - said in a statement it was ""concerned by the excessive use of force"" by authorities. Masonic leader Jose Ramon Vinas went a step further, writing a letter to President Miguel Diaz-Canel accusing the government of always justifying the country's problems through the U.S. trade embargo rather than recognizing its own responsibility. He wrote later on Facebook that had been summoned to a police station where three officials questioned him over the letter. In a show of the growing sense of defiance in Cuban society, he said he suggested they came to visit the masons instead where they could speak on an equal footing. ""As I left, there was a cluster of brothers waiting for me, defying the curfew about to start - Masonic pride... thank you, thank you!""

221,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/20/democrat-lobbyist-ties-haiti-among-bidens-invitees-cuba-zoom-call/,"President Joe Biden invited a lobbying firm executive with ties to Haiti who has not formally worked on Cuba issues for decades to join Cuban celebrities and businesspeople for a Zoom call on protests in the communist nation Tuesday. After a week of inaction following nationwide anti-government protests in Cuba, the Biden Administration finally acted by holding a ""listening session"" Zoom call featuring Gloria and Emilio Estefan, actor Andy Garcia, and several other prominent Cuban-Americans. The virtual meeting Tuesday included former Florida Rep. Joe Garcia (D), a co-chair for a lobbying firm that represents the office of the presidency of Haiti, Politico reported in July 2021. Garcia was once the head of a prominent Cuban-American organization, but his career has taken him far from the topic, raising questions as to why he was at the top of the list of Cuban voices for Biden to reach out to. The office of the presidency of Haiti is currently unoccupied. President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home this month. Haiti also currently lacks a parliament and only resolved its dueling prime minister crisis on Monday. Senior Advisor and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement Cedric Richmond, who once falsely claimed Republicans defunded the police, and Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere for the National Security Council Juan Gonzalez facilitated the call. The White Houses self-described ""listening session"" was held to hear ""policy recommendations"" and ""concerns"" from other Cuban-Americans like Garcia, including Gloria and Emilio Estefan, actress Carmen Pelaez, and actor Andy Garcia. Lawyers, CEOs, entrepreneurs, and former Obama Administration staffers were also on the call, according to CBS Miami. The White House just released a ""readout"" on a ""listening session"" with Cuban American leaders. The WH did not identify who was part of the ZOOM meeting but @CBSMiami has learned the names include Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Andy Garcia, Luis Lauredo, and Carlos Saladrigas. 1/x pic.twitter.com/weJrIEBfhO -- Jim DeFede (@DeFede) July 20, 2021 As of April 2021, Garcias Mercury Public Affairs maintained a contract with the Haitian government, routed through Mercury International UK Ltd, the Miami Herald reported. Moise reportedly hired the group in 2018 to repair Haitis image after Former President Donald Trump called the country a ""shithole"" during a White House meeting. Moise allegedly funneled money into lobbyist groups in an ""effort to get positive international press as detractors accuse(d) him of trying to install a dictatorship with autocratic policies,"" according to the Herald. Opponents protested the money could have gone to combating his countrys hunger crisis, rising crime and kidnappings, and rampant inflation. The U.S. State Department has accused the Haitian government of human rights abuses, including gang killings supported by unnamed officials, excessive use of force by police, arbitrary detentions, a corrupt judiciary system, violence against women, and ""the worst forms of child labor."" Moise denied allegations of being tied to the increasingly powerful gangs controlling the country. Following his death, however, one of those gang leaders -- Jimmy ""Barbecue"" Cherizier -- vocally defended Moise and accused his opposition of organizing an ""international conspiracy"" with Middle Eastern merchants to kill him. Moise took over for predecessor Michel Martelly in the aftermath of the chaotic 2015 elections as a placeholder president. He insisted that his term began in 2017, thus making him legitimate president through 2022, but faced opposition who claimed that his term had expired by this year and branded him a dictator, Breitbart News previously reported. He was assassinated in early July with no clear successor, and parliament in Haitis semi-presidential republic had already collapsed before his death. Moises death also catapulted the country into more political upheaval, with two people dueling for the countrys interim prime minister position. Garcias ties to Cuba policy are decades old. Garcia was named executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation around 2000 -- more than 20 years ago -- before serving as director in the Department of Energy under the Obama Administration in 2009. He also previously served as the first Democrat congressman for District 26 in Florida from 2013-2015, which includes a portion of Miami-Dade County. His stint as a congressman only lasted for one two-year term and was marred by the arrest of his staffer Jeffrey Garcia (no relation). Jeffrey Garcia received probation for funneling campaign money to a phony tea party candidate so he could siphon votes from a Republican rival, Politico reported. ""Joe Garcia denied any knowledge or involvement, but the FBI dug up an email indicating he might have been informed of the scheme,"" according to Politico. Jeffrey Garcia was also caught in a separate absentee-ballot request fraud scheme and served 90 days in jail in 2013. The White House call notably omitted all Cuban-American senators, former political prisoners residing in the United States, and leaders of humanitarian and human rights groups specializing in Cuban issues in Florida. In contrast, former President Donald Trump maintained ties to Cuban-American humanitarian groups and hosted victims of the Castro regime and Cuban dissident leaders with direct experiences in Cuba when he announced policy revisions toward Cuba in 2017. The Biden Administration has noticeably struggled in its messaging about Cuba since protests sparked on the island last week in more than 40 municipalities. White House press secretary Jen Psaki first asserted anti-government protesters were actually protesting the Chinese coronavirus pandemic before admitting ""communism is a failed ideology."" Biden delayed explicitly condemning communism for several days before finally calling Cuba a ""failed state."" Since protests in Cuba began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten people in the streets. Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people so far, Breitbart News reported. Current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued last week. Bidens move to consult celebrities comes soon after hundreds of demonstrators protested in front of the White House demanding U.S. military intervention in Cuba. The administration has reportedly been reviewing its policies toward Cuba and is considering providing humanitarian aid, though nothing has been done yet.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/20/2021 19:06,Lobbyist with Ties to Haiti Among Biden's Invitees to Cuba Zoom Call,"['lobbyist', 'garcia', 'president', 'leaders', 'white', 'invitees', 'biden', 'zoom', 'cuban', 'ties', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'bidens', 'haiti', 'administration']","The White House just released a ""readout"" on a ""listening session"" with Cuban American leaders.

Cuba has been trying to rapidly roll out the two vaccines that it has approved for massive use, Abdala and Soberana, both of which require three jabs. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) HAVANA (AP) -- The COVID-19 pandemic is slamming Cuba like never before, even as the country races to roll out its homegrown vaccines -- the only locally developed shots being widely used in Latin America. The island had seen far fewer infections that most other Latin American nations over the first year or so of the disease, imposing strict quarantines, isolating the infected and shutting down its tourism industry despite devastating economic consequences. But new cases have been soaring in recent weeks, with an average of about 6,000 a day being reported in the country of 11 million people. The first three weeks of July have accounted for about 100,000 of the nearly 300,000 infections recorded altogether in Cuba since the first case arrived some 16 months ago. Cubas national director of epidemiology, Francisco Duran, said Tuesday that 717 people have died so far this month in Cuba -- a heavy share of the 2,019 who have died in all. ADVERTISEMENT Anxiety over that spread was one of the factors that fed into the wave of street protests that broke out across the country on July 11. Duran said transmission is ""very elevated"" now, especially in the central provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos and Ciego de Avila, as well as in Guantanamo, to the east. Theres also been a rise in Havana, the capital. ""Of course we are worried, because we see there is a high incidence in the population, above all in young children,"" said Yurizam Martinez, a 53-year-old nurse in Havana. ""I feel affected psychologically because we have been working for more than a year and we still dont see the result we had hoped for. ... But we have to keep on."" Cuba has been trying to rapidly roll out the two vaccines that it has approved for massive use, Abdala and Soberana, both of which require three jabs. The government reported that both, particularly Abdala, have proven highly effective. Duran said 18.8% of the population is already fully vaccinated and 30.1% has gotten at least one dose. Officials say they hope to have 80% vaccinated by the end of August, and children by September. The surge -- Cubas first real wave of the virus -- appeared to start slowly after some restrictions were relaxed around the start of the year and new variants began to spread around the world. Authorities blamed the delta variant for at least part of the problem in Matanzas, where hospitals were flooded with patients and authorities mobilized brigades of physicians to treat the ill. Pianist Regla de la Caridad Mesa, 60, said she trusted that the islands vaccine campaign will begin to lead to reduced deaths and critical cases. ""We Cubans are a beautiful people, a people who like parties, we like groups. ... We have come through worse things."" ___ Andrea Rodriguez is on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP",['Andrea Rodriguez'],7/20/2021 19:47,Virus slams Cuba as it races to roll out its new vaccines,"['havana', 'virus', 'trying', 'vaccines', 'slams', 'vaccine', 'rapidly', 'cuba', 'roll', 'require', 'abdala', 'races', 'soberana']","Virus slams Cuba as it races to roll out its new vaccinesFILE - In this June 23, 2021 file photo, people sign up for a dose of the Cuban Abdala COVID-19 vaccine in Havana, Cuba.

WASHINGTON D.C. - The island nation of Cuba is facing a shortage when it comes to administering the COVID-19 vaccine. On Tuesday, thanks to thousands of generous citizens, the United States is lending a hand. Six million syringes of the coronavirus vaccine are on their way to Cuba after half a million dollars was donated, five times the goal of $100,000 that organizers had hoped to reach. ""The donations pouring in from Hialeah, from Miami from Fort Lauderdale from the places where Cuban Americans lives,"" said organizer Medea Benjamin. The vaccines should make a big difference for those in Cuba amid the pandemic and with the new Delta Variant spreading. ""These syringes will allow Cubans to continue to inoculate and vaccinate its population,"" said Felix Sharpe-Caballero with the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign. The donation comes on the heels of days of protests for the people of Cuba and a call for President Biden to help. Ad Cuba is also not working with an international organization, or NGA, that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday could, without fear of corruption, distribute doses. ""We would be happy to (send Cuba doses of the vaccine), we would love to get vaccines into the hands of the Cuban people. Cuba has not joined Covax,"" she said. This information coming as the White House ordered a review of US-Cuba policies. A senior administration official said the US is actively pursuing measures that will both support the Cuban people and hold the communist regime accountable for violence, repression and human rights violations. Representatives from the Embassy of Cuba in Washington D.C. pushed back though, blaming the embargo. ""The main cause for these difficulties are caused by again the 243 measures imposed by the past administration,"" said Rodney Gonzalez with the Cuban Embassy.",['Ben Kennedy'],7/20/2021 20:45,Millions of COVID-19 doses heading to Cuba as Biden Administration examines US-Cuba policies,"['heading', 'vaccines', 'white', 'shortage', 'biden', 'cuban', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'policies', 'cuba', 'million', 'syringes', 'examines', 'comes', 'uscuba', 'administration', 'millions', 'covid19']","Cuba is facing a shortage when it comes to administering the COVID-19 vaccine.

224,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuban-opposition-websites-emboldened-protests-roil-government-rcna1451,"Years before becoming president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel pushed for greater public access to the internet at a time when it was only available to a tiny minority. He would eventually succeed in getting much of his country online. Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miamis Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cubaa expanded internet access. The Cuban government has accused independent media outlets largely based in the Miami area of provoking the unprecedented, spontaneous protests that spread across Cuba a week ago. One of the sites it singled out, ADN Cuba, slants its coverage against the government in Havana at every turn. It recently published a photograph of Diaz-Canel that was altered to look like a police mugshot. ""Genocide,"" it said underneath. Its coverage of the protests has concentrated heavily on the people hurt or detained. For days the site led with a story that the nephew of a senior Communist Party leader called on his family and the government to ""lay down your weapons"" and ""listen to the people."" Another headline reported protesters in eastern Cuba shouted ""murderer"" at Deputy Prime Minister Ramiro Valdes. Aiming for a young audience, Miami Beach-based Diario de Cuba closely follows Cuban and Cuban-American musicians critical of the government. One recent front page featured separate headlines on the latest news and views from musicians Pitbull, Lenier Mesa and Maykel Osorbo, while also reporting that Silvio Rodriguez, a longtime ally of Cubas government, was trying to ""rescue"" artists who have abandoned the government. Around a dozen such Cuba-focused news and magazines have their websites blocked in Cuba, but Cubans can access them anyway using virtual private network (VPN) services, and share them on social media sites generally available in Cuba. Some relentlessly berate the government while others, though still critical, strive for more fact-based journalism like the pioneering outlet 14yMedio. The independent site El Toque, which also has a number of Cuba-based staff, published an article debunking false anti-government reports and out-of-context photos circulating on the internet that grossly inflated the size of the demonstrations. While it is difficult to measure the impact of the U.S.-based sites on recent protests in Cuba, the government there certainly sees them as a menace. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez dedicated much of a news conference last week to criticizing ADN Cuba and two journalists by name while also condemning a social media hashtag campaign boosted by bots. He accused opposition media of working for the U.S. government, which funds a number of Cuban opposition media websites with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, according to U.S. records published by the Cuba Money Project. Protesters in Cuba have also spread messages of discontent and word of protests on social media platforms, mostly Facebook, and encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. Many of those sites were blocked following the protests, prompting U.S. President Joe Biden to say he would review whether Washington could help Cubans regain internet access. Even without U.S. help, Cubans find ways to see censored content with circumvention tools such as Psiphon. The company says up to 1.4 million Cubans were using its application to see banned content on some days last week, up from 18,000 per day before the protests. That would mean 20% of Cubas estimated 7 million internet users used that one tool to get around censors. ""Impossible delusion"" In 2013, when he was heir apparent to former President Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel said that continuing to ban the internet in Cuba was an ""almost impossible delusion that doesnt make sense."" Internet access gradually expanded after that and the landscape changed dramatically in December 2018 when Cubans were able to get internet service on their mobile phones for the first time. Readership of opposition media inside Cuba exploded, said Baruch College professor Ted Henken, editor of the recently published book ""Cubas Digital Revolution."" Henken talks to the media outlets, which track their traffic through Google Analytics and other methods. ""Since December 2018 these outlets have gained a huge island audience and left the official media even more exposed as propagandists,"" Henken said. ""They (the Cuban leadership) miscalculated in that they didnt realize that this would very quickly, in two and a half years, blow up in their face."" Rodriguez last week accused ADN Cuba and others of carrying out a plan for which ""U.S. imperialism has worked for a long time."" The U.S. government does provide financial assistance to media outlets critical of the Cuban government. A company closely associated with ADN Cuba received $410,710 from the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote human rights in Cuba last year, journalist Tracey Eaton reported via the Cuba Money Project, which tracks the spending through public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. Representatives for USAID did not respond to a request for comment over the weekend. ADN Cubas founder also did not respond to requests for comment. The two journalists named by Rodriguez declined interviews. Another anti-government website, CubaNet, received $300,000 from USAID in 2020, its director acknowledged. Once a biweekly newsletter printed in Miami, CubaNet now has a team in Cuba in defiance of the authorities, and has published stories on the apparent wealth of the Castro family. Director Hugo Landa said ""we have never hidden"" the U.S. funding and that U.S. officials have never tried to influence coverage. ""If we ever felt any pressure from any of our funders to influence our content, I would renounce that support,"" Landa said. With or without U.S. funding, the sites are trying to reach readers like Jorge Norris, a 35-year-old IT engineer in Cuba, who uses a VPN to read sites such as Diario de Cuba and 14yMedio along with official Cuban media. ""Its another view to be able to form an idea of whats happening in the world,"" Norris said. ""You have to be completely informed of what they say here in Cuba and in the world.""",[],7/21/2021 0:00,"Cuban opposition websites, emboldened by protests, roil government","['media', 'opposition', 'websites', 'roil', 'cuban', 'internet', 'protests', 'published', 'cuba', 'adn', 'cubans', 'week', 'emboldened', 'sites']","Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miamis Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cubaa expanded internet access.

225,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/are-protests-beginning-end-cubas-communist-government-rcna1460,"The historic and spontaneous protests that rocked Cuba on July 11 took the communist government -- and the international community -- by surprise in terms of their intensity and numbers. Many analysts concur there probably wont be any immediate changes to the countrys one-party communist rule. But experts said its a watershed moment that marks a ""before"" and ""after"" the protests -- and they have put an enormous amount of pressure on the government to speed up reforms. While people across Cuba protested shortages of food and medicine amid a higher number of Covid-19 cases, rising prices due to inflation and hourslong power outages, many also chanted ""libertad"" (freedom) and ""We want change,"" while holding signs that read, ""Down with the dictatorship."" In a country like Cuba where the government has significant control over many aspects of life, including industries, wages, imports and prices of goods, its all intertwined. Independent journalist Yoani Sanchez tweeted, ""We were so hungry, we ate our fear."" Were the protests significant enough to change the countrys one-party political system? ""I think some caution is in order,"" said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University. He said what was remarkable about the protests was that they could not have been predicted and they were decentralized in the way they unfolded. ""It wasnt called for by the opposition, let alone the government. It just kind of happened,"" Bustamante said. ""I think that supposes real challenges if you wanted to channel this into something. How do you do that?"" Arturo Lopez-Levy, a former analyst with Cubas Interior Ministry and assistant professor at Holy Names University, said he does not expect any major political changes in the short term. But he added that the protests do put pressure on the government ""to make economic changes and to liberalize the politics within the one-party system."" In other words, Lopez-Levy said, it could open the door for more than one candidate to run within their one-party system by allowing an independent candidate to run, similar to how Iran allows moderate and conservative candidates to run in their elections. Other changes could potentially include transferring responsibilities from the central government to the provinces and requiring authorities to identify where arrested people are taken, something that was approved in the 2019 constitution that authorities are not currently complying with. The protests rattled the government. Raul Castro -- the 90-year-old brother of the late Fidel Castro who recently retired as head of the Communist Party -- emerged from retirement to attend a mass government rally. President Miguel Diaz-Canel went as far as to take some blame for the current crisis, but only after he called on government supporters to go out and fight during the protests. The call to combat further riled many Cubans. Cubas government has repeatedly blamed the U.S. governments decades-old economic embargo as a catalyst for the conditions and shortages that have led to the historic protests. The harsh response against the protesters by police and civilian supporters armed with sticks has drawn international condemnation from the United Nations, governments and rights groups in a way not seen in years. Supporters of the Cuban government participate in a demonstration in Havana on Saturday. Adalberto Roque / AFP - Getty Images After more than 60 years of revolution and U.S. sanctions, Cubas buildings are crumbling and at times collapsing, and over 60 percent of the food is imported. This year, the island produced the lowest amount of sugar, an export the island used to rely on heavily, since 1908. For years, Cubans seeking a better life immigrated to other countries. But for the first time, Cubans, particularly younger generations, are seeking change inside Cuba, putting a level of pressure on the government not seen before in communist Cuba, and it comes at a time when there are no Castros in power. ""I dont know how many times in my life I have heard the prediction that this [communism] is coming to an end,"" said former Cuban diplomat Jesus Arboleya, a professor at the University of Havana. He said no one can deny there is significant opposition in Cuba. ""The problem is finding a way to channel those discrepancies or that opposition through better channels,"" he said. People have drawn comparisons between Cubas protests and demonstrations that erupted in Venezuela and Nicaragua, close allies of the Caribbean island. Venezuela has a more organized opposition with a leader, Juan Guaido, and theyve held massive, sustained protests in past years. During 2018 anti-government protests in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortegas government responded violently with force. In both cases, scores were killed, and the leaders still have a firm grip on power.

Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images ""Whats different about the protests in Cuba by comparison to those in Venezuela and Nicaragua is that Cubans have been operating in a closed and repressive system for decades,"" said Paul J. Angelo, a fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. In other Latin American countries, protest movements have been common and recurring since the countries transitioned to authoritarian rule. ""Just as democratization processes across Latin America followed different paths and responded to different internal and external inducements during the 1980s and 1990s,"" Angelo said, ""so too will the democratization processes of the 2020s -- if we can achieve them."" Analysts agree the Cuban government will speed up economic reforms -- such as more foreign investment -- that had been promised by then-President Raul Castro but not fully implemented. How far these reforms go and whether they include political changes could depend on whether demonstrators keep the pressure and momentum that stunned so many on July 11.

226,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/-are-no-longer-afraid-thousands-cubans-protest-government-rcna1386,"Thousands of Cubans took to the streets across the country on Sunday in an unusual protest in which civilians shouted slogans against the Communist government, such as ""We want freedom"" and ""We are no longer afraid."" The demonstrations came at a time when Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, an increase in repression against political opponents and a strained health system during a critical stage of the pandemic. Health authorities reported almost 7,000 new cases and 47 deaths -- a record for infections and deaths on the Caribbean island of just over 11 million people. In Miami, hundreds of people gathered in the Little Havana neighborhood in solidarity with the growing protests in Cuba. ""I know my family in Cuba is struggling, people are dying. Its terrible,"" Miami resident Christian Guzman told NBC station WTVJ. ""Right now its hard. Theres no food, theres no medicine. The Covid outbreak. The whole country is in the streets,"" another Miami resident, Dario Suarez, said. People take part in a demonstration in Havana, on July 11, 2021. Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images In Cuba, the protests began early Sunday afternoon in the municipality of San Antonio de los Banos, in the Artemisa province, adjacent to Havana. A few hours later they had spread to the east of the country, in provinces such as Santiago de Cuba. The central Malecon of the capital, where in August 1994 Cubans staged a historic protest against then-leader Fidel Castro that was violently repressed, also saw hundreds of protesters gather on Sunday. Cubans in several provinces contacted by Noticias Telemundo confirmed that the government, which controls the only internet provider company on the island, has caused service outages to prevent live broadcasts. ""They do not want the world to see what is happening in Cuba,"" said a resident from Havana who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals from the regime. President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on national television to call on the Army to confront the protesters: ""The order to fight has been given,"" he said. In Cuba, videos broadcast on social networks, which could be verified by Noticias Telemundo, show special agents known in Cuba as Black Berets, being deployed in some localities and violently detaining civilians who protested and sang peacefully. Diaz-Canel also called ""all the revolutionaries in the country, all the communists, to take to the streets and go to the places where these provocations are going to take place."" In recent days, Cuban exiles and high-profile personalities have joined the #SOSCuba campaign to demand that the islands authorities open a humanitarian channel that allows the entry of medicines and supplies to treat the almost 240,000 patients with coronavirus. The authorities have mocked the initiative on national television and described it as an attempt to discredit the governments management of the health crisis, which has the islands hospitals on the edge. Cubans whose relatives have died from coronavirus in recent days have gone on social networks to talk about the seriousness of the health crisis, which currently has its epicenter in the province of Matanzas, known for Varadero, a popular beach resort town. ""My mother just died. We were in isolation for four days. Four days calling the SIUM (Integrated System of Medical Emergencies) to come and look for her. Four days and the SIUM did not arrive,"" said Magdiel Matos outside a hospital in Matanzas. Opposition artists and independent journalists have said for weeks that the government has maintained police patrols outside their homes, while reports persist of patients who could not be transferred to hospitals on time due to lack of transportation and resources. ""Take these patrols to transport the sick, open the hotels to house them, facilitate the arrival of donated medicines and medical utensils,"" poet and activist Katherine Bisquet said from Havana, pointing out a police car stationed in the basement of the building. Cuba did not join COVAX, the World Health Organization agency that seeks to disseminate Covid-19 vaccines in poorer countries, instead betting on the production of its own vaccines. One of those five vaccine candidates, Abdala, received approval for emergency use this week. The government has stated that the vaccine, the first produced in Latin America, is 92.8 percent effective after three doses, but has not published data on clinical studies and it hasn't received the approval of any international health organization. In Miami, with the largest community of Cuban exiles in the U.S., Cuban-born congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar said, ""We have not seen in recent years a popular uprising as big as this one."" Mass protests are rare on the island and, when they do occur, they are quickly put down. Cuban politicians and the official press, the only one allowed by law in Cuba, often discredit dissidents by saying that they respond to the interests of the United States and that they receive funding for subversion. The acting deputy secretary of the U.S. State Departments Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Julie Chung, defended the protests on Twitter, saying that peaceful protests were growing as people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express their concern over the increase in Covid-19 cases and deaths. The coronavirus crisis, which caused the closure of airports and slowed tourism by more than 80 percent -- Cubas second source of income after its medical missions -- has exacerbated the shortage and fueled popular discontent. The Cuban government attributes the economic crisis to U.S. embargo against Cuba and sanctions, which former President Donald Trump intensified. The Biden Administration has shown no signs of wanting to roll back sanctions, instead demanding that the government release political prisoners and respect dissenting voices.

A few hours later they had spread to the east of the country, in provinces such as Santiago de Cuba. The central Malecon of the capital, where in August 1994 Cubans staged a historic protest against then-leader Fidel Castro that was violently repressed, also saw hundreds of protesters gather on Sunday.

227,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-lives-matter-faces-backlash-statement-cuba-protest-rcna1438,"The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation is facing backlash after calling for the end of the U.S. governments embargo on Cuba while praising the country for its ""solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent"" amid historic anti-government protests. In the statement shared Thursday on social media, the organization urged the U.S. to lift the embargo immediately and appeared to praise the country. ""The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" the message read. The statement has drawn the ire of academics and organizers who say that while the decadeslong embargo should be lifted, the statement both lets the Cuban government off the hook for its own history of systemic racism and ignores the protesters demands for change. ""It was surprising to me that Black Lives Matter came out with a statement focusing solely on the U.S. and not talking about why all of those folks are protesting, not coming out in solidarity of Black folks on the ground who are protesting,"" said Danielle Clealand, associate professor of Mexican American and Latina/o studies at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of ""The Power of Race in Cuba."" ""Its just disappointing that the statement took this kind of stance that 'This is all the U.S. when we know there is a lack of civil liberties in Cuba. We know that Cuba has a history of anti-Black racism."" In an email to NBC News, Black Lives Matter officials said their statement was ""grounded in our unequivocal support for Cuba,"" and vowed to amplify the voices of Afro-Cuban protesters protesting oppression ""from all actors, including the United States Embargo."" ""We unequivocally join in solidarity with the Cuban people against repression and violence from internal and unseen external actors,"" officials said in the statement. ""We also understand that Anti-Blackness exists within Cuba and is a Global issue. We struggle for and alongside Black people across the diaspora for liberation and self-sovereignty."" In its original message, BLM noted that Black and brown people make up a large portion of the Cuban population. The country's 2012 Census reported that Black people made up 9.3 percent of Cubas 11.1 million population. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in an unprecedented demonstration on Sunday to protest the government amid severe economic shortages and Covid-19 deaths. People have protested in solidarity around the world, including in New York, New Jersey and Miami -- which all have large Cuban American populations. During demonstrations in Cuba, protestors demanded ""libertad"" -- freedom -- and shouted ""down with the dictatorship."" Cubans have endured food and medicine shortages, severe inflation, power outages and limited access to basic supplies. And the pandemic has only exacerbated the countrys economic crisis. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, which was tightened by the Trump administration. However, critics say the matter is much more complicated and accused the Cuban government of using the embargo to distract from its own actions. Activists, organizers and economists alike have criticized the embargo and the countrys Soviet-style, centrally planned economy, holding that both are to blame for the country's problems. ""Reforms in Cuba do not depend on the embargo, and the embargo should be eliminated unilaterally, independently from reforms in Cuba. Both cause problems,"" Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia, previously told NBC News. As for Black Lives Matter, Clealand said the statement missed the mark not because it took aim at the U.S. embargo, but because it failed to also address the concerns of Cubans protesting their own government. Afro-Cubans have routinely been pushed to the margins in the country, with only 11 percent of Black Cubans reporting owning a bank account and 70 percent of Black and mixed-race Cubans saying they didnt have internet access, according to The New York Times. Meanwhile, scholars have fought for years to have Afro-Cuban history taught in schools. ""You have to talk to folks on the ground before you make statements about them. I think thats what a lot of Black Cubans feel frustrated about,"" Clealand said. ""Theres not one position on the revolution within Cuba, particularly among Black folks. There are Black folks that have been longtime supporters of the revolution that feel like they must critique the way the revolution has ignored racism and not centered Black folks."" ""Theres a lot of nuance there that the statement misses,"" she continued. ""Folks on the ground are fighting for freedom, and theyre not talking about the U.S. embargo. The embargo is widely hated in Cuba, but its really not the center so the statement ... tries to put all the onus on the United States when we have to also pay attention to how the policies in Cuba affect Black folks."" Black Cuban organizations in the country have done their best to send out their own messages in the wake of the protests. Alianza Afro-Cubana, an advocacy organization for Black LGBTQ Cubans, said in a social media statement that the Cuban government ""should listen to the people, serve them"" instead of criminalizing them. The group called on Black Lives Matter to ""sit down and have a conversation about solidarity."" ""We call on activists and anti racist groups to be concerned about the situation of Black people, who bear the heaviest burden of violence,"" the statement reads. ""Cuba continues to show its racist reality and that justice has a selective condition.""

228,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-starts-handing-sentences-historic-protests-rcna1481,"HAVANA -- An anti-government hip hop song by some of Cubas most popular musicians in exile became the anthem of the unprecedented protests that rocked the Communist-run country last week. Now the visual artist who filmed the Cuban section of the videoclip for ""Patria y Vida"" ('Homeland and Life), Anyelo Troya, 25, has been sentenced to a year in prison, according to relatives. He was charged with instigating unrest, they said, after attending a demonstration in Havana. Rights activists say this is just the start of what they predict will be a wave of summary trials of hundreds of people detained during and after the unusual protests on July 11 and 12 that the government has blamed on U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. ""They took him to trial without defense or lawyer or anything,"" Troyas mother Raisa Gonzalez told Reuters after witnessing his sentencing in what she called a collective trial of around a dozen people. The Cuban Foreign Ministrys International Press Center, which fields all requests from foreign journalists for comment from state entities, did not immediately reply to request for comment on the cases mentioned in this article. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday they had started the trials of those detained on charges of instigating unrest, committing vandalism, propagating the coronavirus pandemic, or assault, charges that could carry prison sentences of up to 20 years. ""There are people who will receive the response that Cuban legislation allows for, and it will be energetic,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on state television last week. He promised there would be due legislative procedure. But Gonzalez said she was not informed of her sons trial in time and when she arrived at the court with her lawyer, he had already been convicted. The trial was denounced by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) for taking place without proper defense or due process. Troya had already been under heightened vigilance for his participation in the song, whose headline is a twist on the revolutionary slogan 'Patria o Muerte ('Homeland or Death), his mother said. Javier Larrondo, a representative of the human rights organization Cuban Prisoners Defenders, said authorities would likely lock up the most charismatic and effective opposition leaders, who lately have often been young artists, whether or not they were at the protests. ""We will have hundreds of political prisoners in just two weeks,"" he said. The protests against Cubas worst economic crisis in decades and curbs on civil liberties first erupted ten days ago in a small town before spreading throughout the country. By the evening of day two, they appeared to have dissipated amid heavy security operations and internet disruptions. The government blamed mercenaries exploiting frustrations with hardships caused by U.S. sanctions. Exiled rights group Cubalex, which has established a spreadsheet of those detained that it updates every day as new reports come in, says more than 500 Cubans appear to have been detained during the protests or afterwards. It said the tally was likely higher, but some families may fear reporting the arrest of relatives in case of reprisals such as losing their state sector jobs. Some of those detained, like theater director Yunior Garcia, have been released to house arrest. ""I have four officials in front of my door preventing me going out,"" Garcia told Reuters, which observed the officials. ""When I go to buy food or cigarettes, one of them goes with me to keep a close eye on me."" The majority of those detained have been kept incommunicado, while the location of some is still unknown, said Cubalex and HRW, based on interviews with relatives. Cubans have been posting photos of people they say they cannot locate or sharing stories of detentions on a Facebook group called 'Disappeared #SOSCuba with more than 10,000 members. ""We went from police station to police station looking for her,"" said Alberto Betancourt of his sister, a stay-at-home mother-of-two who was detained at a protest in Havana. He located her after six days. ""They wont let me speak to her,"" he told Reuters, holding back tears. ""But shes not a criminal. She just let herself be swept up in the crowds."" Cuban interior ministry officials denied on Tuesday that anyone was missing and said a list of detainees circulating -- they did not specify which -- was manipulated and included people who were never detained. The detained include high profile dissidents like Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who also featured in ""Patria y Vida,"" and Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the countrys largest opposition group. They also include ordinary citizens and bystanders, families and rights groups say. Many of those detained had been beaten or mistreated by security forces or rapid-reaction brigades -- government-organized bands of civilian recruits, said HRW senior researcher Juan Pappier. Used to quiet streets, Cubans have been shocked over the last week by images of violence that have emerged on social media: security forces and bands of stick-wielding people in civilian garb beating protesters, as well as protesters throwing stones at police and overturning police cars. Diaz-Canel said last week ""maybe there will be a need for apologies to anyone who, in the middle of all the confusion, has been mistreated,"" and defended security forces actions to re-establish ""peace.""

229,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/freedom-cuban-americans-say-shortages-dont-explain-protests-rcna1437,"MIAMI -- As Cubans took to the streets to protest in numbers not seen since before the 1959 Revolution, Cuban Americans are challenging the view that the demonstrations are just about economic frustration. While Cubans expressed anger over shortages in food and medicine, rising inflation and power outages -- amid the challenges of Covid-19 -- many of the chants throughout the island called for political change and included expressions such as ""libertad"" (liberty), ""We want change"" and ""Down with the dictatorship."" Many Cuban Americans say that should not be glossed over. ""For the first time in 62 years, they are risking their lives from one end of the island to the other to demand accountability from the regime,"" Carmen Pelaez, a Cuban American filmmaker and Democratic political consultant, said. ""Im anti-embargo. But its not about the embargo right now. Thats not what this fight is about."" In the U.S., Cuban Americans hold different positions on U.S.-Cuba relations, some falling along party lines. But while conservatives and Republicans are known for a more hard-line stance against Cuba, some progressives have been denouncing the Cuban governments tough stance against activists' calls for greater freedom of expression. Many Cuban Americans have grown up hearing calls for ""libertad"" for Cuba in the streets of Miami and other U.S. cities, but its seldom heard in Cuba. Some Cuban Americans said it was emotional to hear the word being shouted by so many on the island. ""Policy differences aside, Cuban Americans strongly agree and understand that these protests are not about the embargo or even food shortages. Its opposition to the regime,"" said Giancarlo Sopo, a conservative media strategist. ""It doesnt matter if youre a Republican or a Democrat. We all recognize what these protests are about,"" said Sopo, adding that the chants called for ""libertad."" Cuba has been run by a Communist government, with a strong grip on society, for over six decades. Though the government has received praise for its ability to offer primary care to its population, it also determines many aspects of peoples lives, including wages, food and internet prices, as well as their freedom of assembly, expression and the ability to choose a president that does not belong to the Communist Party of Cuba. After the protests, Cubas government announced it would temporarily lift restrictions on the amount of toiletries, food and medicine that Cuban citizens can bring back home when they take foreign trips, but for many protesters on the island its a small concession compared to their demands, and out of touch with their basic needs. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel took some blame for the protests recently, saying failings by the government played a role, though he still says the United States is primarily at fault. Before the protests began on Sunday, public displays of dissent had been increasing in recent months. In November, authorities broke up a hunger strike by members of the San Isidro Movement, an artists collective, sparking a rare protest with hundreds of artists and activists in front of the Culture Ministry. Those who protested formed another group, called 27N. The leader of the San Isidro Movement, Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, went on a hunger strike in May and was forcibly taken to the hospital on the seventh day, drawing international attention and condemnation. Following the protests, the government faced scrutiny over its shutdown of social media and messaging apps. The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, on Friday urged Cubas government to address protesters grievances and called for the prompt release of all those detained. ""I am very concerned at the alleged use of excessive force against demonstrators in Cuba and the arrest of a large number of people, including several journalists,"" Bachelet said in a statement. ""It is particularly worrying that these include individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are unknown."" The streets of the capital, Havana, have been calm in recent days but a heavy police presence remains. Since Sundays protests, 55 out of 383 people who were detained nationwide have been freed, according to Cubalex, a human rights group based in the U.S. The words ""Cuba Libre"" or ""free Cuba"" was painted in large block letters on the street in directly in front of the Cuban embassy in Washington D.C. on Friday. For Cuba's government, the challenge will be to manage the acute economic crisis and the pandemic, while addressing human rights concerns and growing calls for ""libertad"" in Cuba and abroad. Cuban American musician Pitbull said in a widely shared video on Twitter that he felt frustrated ""having a platform to speak to the world and not being able to help my own people, not being able to get them food, not being able to get them water, not being able to get them medicine. But most of all, not being able to help and really get them what they deserve, which is freedom.""

230,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-battles-highest-covid-19-caseload-latin-america-rcna1453,"HAVANA -- Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, now has the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare protests that have roiled the Communist-run island. The Caribbean nation of 11 million people reported nearly 4,000 confirmed cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average and more than any other country in the Americas for its size. The outbreak, fueled by the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant first identified in India, has pushed hospitals at the virus epicenter in the province of Matanzas to the brink. State media has shown rare images of patients in beds in corridors and doctors complaining of a lack of oxygen, ventilators and medicines. Cubas handling of the pandemic was one of the issues that propelled thousands to take to the streets nationwide last Sunday in unprecedented anti-government demonstrations in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. Demonstrators also protested shortages of food and medicines and curbs on civil liberties. Cuba is not alone in struggling under new waves of the pandemic. But the political implications of such a crisis are greater in a country where healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of its ""revolutionary"" one-party system. Moreover the outbreak and subsequent lockdown and reduction in numbers of flights has taxed an already bankrupt economy where many work in tourism and others rely on travelers to bring in remittances and goods including medicine. ""The government has consistently made the case that one of the main accomplishments of the revolution is its world-class medical sector,"" said Cuban American historian Daniel Rodriguez, author of a book on medical politics in post-independence Havana. Rodriguez said the exacerbation of food and medicine shortages over the past year due to the pandemic-related economic crisis had already broken Cubas social pact. ""When the pandemic began spiraling out of control a couple of weeks ago, it appeared increasingly the revolutionary government was no longer able to protect Cuban lives, and the result was an extraordinary repudiation of the revolution itself."" ""Not even medicine"" Cubas government has blamed the demonstrations on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions tightened during the pandemic. Several countries and non-government organizations including Oxfam called on Washington to lift sanctions this week. On Saturday, authorities organized pro-government rallies across the island attended by thousands. But many Cubans have aimed their anger at their own governments handling of the economy and the pandemic. ""We are hungry, theres nothing at the moment, not even medicine,"" said Aylin Sardina, 33, at a protest in Havana. Some critics complained that the authorities appeared to have ample transport to deploy security forces to quell protests and bus state workers to rallies, while lacking ambulances. To be sure, Cuba has had some pandemic successes, notably the development of five vaccine candidates, two of which have proven to have efficacy of more than 90%,according to preliminary Cuban data. read more Thanks to one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita rates in the world, it was also able to send its ""white coat army"" to help other countries, and lately to reinforce hospitals in Matanzas. Moreover cumulative cases per capita are still below the global average, while deaths per capita, though rising, are still just a third of the global average, a fact Cuba credits to its experimental treatments and its free, universal healthcare. However, with cases now rising fast, a deepening of Cubas economic crisis has prevented officials from imposing stricter lockdowns with many Cubans having to stand in lines for hours to get scarce goods. And so far only some two million people -- less than a fifth of the population -- are fully vaccinated. Brazil-based Cuban virologist Amilcar Perez Riverol said that premature triumphal statements from state media about the Cuban vaccine candidates and rallies like Saturdays may have also led to people lowering their guard, creating a breeding ground for cases to soar. The country has an ambitious aims to have fully vaccinated 70 percent of the population by September. But Perez Riverol warned that in the next few weeks COVID-19 deaths would likely continue to rise as they lagged the surge in cases. ""You go out onto the street to buy food and someone says to you: do you know who else died?"" said Libia Ortega, 44, a worker in a private cafeteria in Matanzas city closed due to the pandemic and shortages of products. ""The doctors are making a big effort to save lives every day,"" said Ortega, ""but medicine and supplies are lacking.""

231,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/us-announces-cuba-sanctions-biden-meets-cuban-american-leaders-rcna1567,"The Biden administration imposed new sanctions against two top Cuban officials and the Cuban National Revolutionary Police for their role in the crackdown against anti-government protesters in Cuba. The announcement came right before President Joe Biden hosted Cuban-American leaders, including Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Manny Diaz, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, at the White House Friday afternoon to discuss the sanctions and other aspects of the U.S. response the regimes violent suppression of peaceful protests. The Treasury actions against two Cuban police force officials, Oscar Callejas Valcarcel and Eddy Sierra Arias, were in response to ""actions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests in Cuba that began on July 11,"" according to the U.S. Treasury Dept. statement. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Andrea M. Gacki in a press release on Friday. ""Todays action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights."" Biden said that the governments crackdown amounted to a ""brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people"" and accused the regime of putting demonstrators in mass detentions and hosting sham trials. As part of the U.S. response, Biden said his administration was expanding assistance to political prisoners and exploring ways to bring internet to the island, as well as ways to increase the flow of remittances to the Cuban people without the military being able to take a cut. He also said there would be more sanctions in the coming days ""unless theres some drastic change"" in the Cuban regimes behavior, but added that he did not anticipate that happening. Cuban Americans have been denouncing the arrests of protesters in the communist-run island following historic protests on July 11, a rare event in the communist-run island not seen since the 1959 revolution.

Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images The protests in Cuba were sparked by the islands severe economic crisis, including shortages in food and medicine, as well as rolling blackouts, but also included calls for ""libertad"" or ""freedom."" Many chanted ""we want change"" and ""down with the dictatorship."" Over 700 people are being held by the government, according to human rights organizations. There have been reports of some people being held incommunicado and others receiving summary trials, which Cuba has denied. The protests ended with security forces and civilians with sticks beating protesters and arrests. For weeks, Cuban Americans have held protests and rallies in support of those on the island and called on Biden to take more action against Havana. Cuban Americans are an important voter bloc, and former President Donald Trump won a majority of their support in Florida. Cubas government has largely blamed the United States and the decadeslong economic embargo for the protests and said demonstrators were also incited on social media. In the U.S., Cuban Americans have held protests and rallies in support of those on the island and called on Biden to take more action against Havana. The Treasury Department announced sanctions last week against Cubas defense minister and an elite brigade of government security forces that took part in the crackdown on protesters. The White House has held several meetings with Cuban American leaders and members of Congress since the protests swept through the island. Yotuel Romero, one of the performers of the song ""Patria y Vida,"" or ""Homeland and life,"" a phrase that was shouted repeatedly during the protests, was at the White House meeting. ""Patria y Vida"" has become a sort of anthem in protests and is a play on the revolutionary slogan ""Homeland or Death."" CEO of eMerge Americas and Roots of Hope founder L. Felice Gorordo as well as Miami Freedom Project co-founder, Ana Sofia Pelaez, were also in attendance.

232,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexico-president-sending-fuel-cargo-cuba-sovereign-decision-rcna1533,"MEXICO CITY -- Mexicos president asserted his countrys right to send fuel to Cuba and said on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions on the island were ""inhumane,"" after a diesel cargo shipped by Mexicos state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos arrived in Cubas Havana port. Mexicos left-leaning President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has criticized the U.S. embargo against Cuba and pledged support for the Communist-run island, which has been hit by a surge in coronavirus infections and an economic slump that triggered rare protests this month. A shipment of humanitarian aid departed from the Mexican port of Veracruz on Tuesday destined for Cuba, and another is scheduled to set sail on Wednesday, carrying food, oxygen tanks and other medical supplies, Mexicos foreign ministry said in a release. Members of the Mexican Navy load humanitarian aid including medical supplies for Cuba in Veracruz, Mexico, on July 24, 2021. Victor Yanez / AFP - Getty Images ""We are an independent nation,"" Lopez Obrador said at a news conference in response to a question about whether deliveries risked contravening the U.S. embargo on the Communist-run island. Lopez Obrador criticized policies he said made it difficult for ships that delivered goods to Cuba to then dock in U.S. ports, which constitutes one of the main aspects of the embargo. Mexicos foreign ministry said the aid is part of a cooperation agreement between Mexico and Cuba. Authorities in Havana have long said the decades-old U.S. embargo on Cuba has caused widespread hardship on the island, where thousands took to the streets this month in the protests. Cuban Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca welcomed on Monday Mexicos pledge of two shipments of aid: ""We are not alone,"" he said on Twitter. The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment and the State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment. John S. Kavulich, president of New-York based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said there were no specific U.S. sanctions preventing the sale -- or donation -- of Mexican fuel to Cuba. ""The U.S. embargo on Cuba is not focused on Cubas imports but on U.S exports to Cuba,"" Kavulich said, adding that the Caribbean island did not appear to be a foreign policy priority for U.S. President Joe Biden. Lopez Obrador, who on Monday called on Biden to ""make a decision"" about the ""inhumane"" embargo on Cuba, last week had anticipated that Mexico would send fuel to generate electricity for the islands hospitals. The Jose Maria Morelos II, a tanker owned and managed by a Pemex unit, departed last week from the Mexican port of Coatzacoalcos bound for the Caribbean, according to Refinitiv Eikon tanker monitoring data. The vessel, which is carrying some 100,000 barrels of diesel according to the foreign ministrys release, has not updated its port of destination, but it docked at the Havana port late on Monday, the Eikon data showed. It is yet unclear which Cuban entity will receive the fuel. Cubas dependence on diesel has increased in recent years as power plants using fuel oil and crude have been in urgent need of investment and maintenance. The island is also struggling to supply power plants with natural gas, said Jorge Pinon from the University of Texas at Austin. An oil-for-services arrangement between Venezuela and Cuba ran afoul of U.S. sanctions on the South American oil producer when in 2019 the U.S. Department of Treasury blacklisted a group of tanker owners and vessels involved in the shipments, at the Venezuelan oppositions request. Cubas economy has been damaged by Venezuelas collapse, along with a slump in tourism following the global coronavirus pandemic.

233,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cubas-president-blasting-us-embargo-takes-blame-protests-rcna1429,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel insisted on blaming the United States and an embargo he calls ""genocidal"" for the huge protests that recently gripped the island, but also recognized that his government was partly to blame. ""We also have to make a critical analysis of our own problems so we can act, so we can overcome, and prevent them from repeating themselves, so we can transform situations,"" Diaz-Canel said during a speech on Wednesday. He also doubled down on previous comments about the protests being orchestrated by the United States. He said the U.S. embargo limits what they can achieve and called it ""cruel"" and ""genocidal."" Some of those who participated, he said, ""respond to a foreign plan, that are irreconcilably against the Cuban revolution, and dont think like Cubans. They think under the guises of the empire,"" he said, referring to the United States. He said other groups that were involved in the protests included ""delinquents, ""unsatisfied people"" and ""young people."" Cuba's prime minister, Manuel Marrero, who also spoke Wednesday, said that starting Monday until the end of the year, the government would lift restrictions on the amount of food and medicine that travelers are allowed to bring into the country. This had been a demand on social media among many Cubans using the hashtag #SOSCuba before the protests erupted. However, Cuba has limited the amount of flights to Cuba, particularly from the United States, in an attempt to reduce the amount of Covid-19 infections circulating on the island. The island has been grappling with a record number of cases and deaths recently. Thousands spontaneously took to the streets Sunday that have caught the attention of the world after decades of relatively little or no unrest. The lifting of restrictions on food and medicine is a small step considering the demands that protesters have been making, including calls for an end to over 60 years of communist rule. Diaz-Canel said Wednesday that the country lacked a ""tremendous amount of hard currency so we always have an enormous list of what the country needs."" The tipping point for many Cubans was the dire economic crisis they are facing that includes acute shortages in food and medicine, increasing prices due to inflation, and 12-hour blackouts in the sweltering heat. Among the many chants Cubans could be heard demanding ""freedom,"" ""we want change,"" and ""homeland and life."" Police cracked down on protests that had carried over to Monday, while authorities blocked social media and messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. On Wednesday people were beginning to access these apps again. Internationally, calls from human rights groups, the United Nations, and several countries have grown louder, demanding Cubas government to be more tolerant of demonstrations and for police to use less force. Cubans living abroad in Spain, Mexico and other countries have broken out into protests and rallies in support of their relatives back home. At a protest rally in Miami on Wednesday, the heart of the exile community, the group Gente de Zona performed their song ""Patria y Vida"" or ""Homeland and Life"" that has become a sort of anthem for those in Cuba demanding liberty. The title of the song is a play on the socialist revolutionary slogan ""patria or muerte"" or ""homeland or death"" that Cubans grew up with.

234,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cubans-protest-government-cracks-internet-access-messaging-apps-rcna1400,"As protests grip Cuba, the country's government has taken steps to block citizens use of the encrypted chat apps WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, researchers say. The entire country went offline for more than 30 minutes on Sunday, according to researchers who study internet censorship. Since then, virtual private networks, which are tools used to reroute internet traffic that can circumvent some internet censorship, and popular communication apps in Cuba have been blocked. Cubans have taken to the streets since Sunday to protest against the government in the midst of an economic downturn and a major health crisis, as the country still struggles to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters have organized online and shared videos of police detentions. But since the protests began, the country has experienced widespread online censorship. Various governments including those in Venezuela and Iran have in recent years sought to limit or block internet access during protests. Widespread internet use in Cuba is still relatively new, and Cubans mostly reach the web through their smartphones. The country only has a single major internet provider, the national telecommunications company ETECSA. That means most Cubans have to rely on a single, centralized, government-affiliated hub, making government censorship substantially easier. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring company, said Monday that it had detected disruptions to multiple messaging apps through ETECSAs service. ETECSA did not respond to a request for comment, and has not made a public statement about the outages. A number of messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, are all blocked in Cuba, said Arturo Filasto, the project lead at the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI). OONI, an international nonprofit, relies on volunteers around the world to install a program that probes for which types of internet use are being censored and how. Its data showed that ETECSA began blocking WhatsApp on Sunday night, then Signal and Telegram on Monday. All three were still blocked on Tuesday, Filasto said. ""We have never seen instant messaging apps being blocked in the country,"" he said. ""Its sort of unprecedented that we would see such a heavy crackdown on the internet in Cuba."" Marianne Diaz Hernandez, a fellow at the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, said some Cubans have reported that their specific SIM cards for their phones have been rendered useless, keeping them offline. And some virtual private networks have themselves been blocked, she said. Two major VPNs, Tor and Psiphon, appear to still work. While Cuba has deployed various censorship techniques in the past, this is the first time they have all been deployed at the same time, Hernandez said. ""Since they have had internet, this is the largest blackout in history,"" she said. Grisel Martin, a native of the Cuban city of Matanzas who lives in Miami, said that the blackout has kept her from communicating with family there. ""The latest news I got from them was Sunday, July 11, 5:10 p.m. through WhatsApp, saying that my aunt had a fever the previous night,"" Martin said. ""We feel so desperate and powerless,"" she said. CORRECTION (July 14, 2021, 8:39 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the business status of NetBlocks. It is a for-profit company, not a non-profit organization.","['Kevin Collier Is A Reporter Covering Cybersecurity', 'Privacy', 'Technology Policy For Nbc News.']",7/21/2021 0:00,"As Cubans protest, government cracks down on internet access and messaging apps","['cracks', 'access', 'protest', 'apps', 'telegram', 'whatsapp', 'internet', 'blocked', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'nonprofit', 'censorship', 'country', 'signal', 'messaging']","As protests grip Cuba, the country's government has taken steps to block citizens use of the encrypted chat apps WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, researchers say.

235,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/biden-host-cuban-american-leaders-discuss-response-cuba-protests-rcna1552,"President Joe Biden will host Cuban American leaders at the White House on Friday to discuss the recent historic protests in the Caribbean nation and his administrations response, including new sanctions on Cuban leaders and establishing internet access for Cubans. Those in attendance will include political and community leaders as well as artists. Thousands of Cubans throughout the island took to the streets July 11 and showed a level of dissent not seen since the 1959 revolution. The protests were sparked by the islands severe economic crisis, including shortages in food and medicine, as well as rolling blackouts, but also included calls for ""libertad"" or ""freedom."" Many chanted ""we want change"" and ""down with the dictatorship."" The protests ended with security forces and civilians with sticks beating protesters and arrests. Cubas government has largely blamed the United States and the decadeslong economic embargo for the protests and said demonstrators were also incited on social media. Over 700 people are being held by the government, according to human rights organizations. There have been reports of some people being held incommunicado and others receiving summary trials, which Cuba has denied. In the U.S., Cuban Americans have held protests and rallies in support of those on the island and called on Biden to take more action against Havana. The Treasury Department announced sanctions last week against Cubas defense minister and an elite brigade of government security forces that took part in the crackdown on protesters. The White House has held several meetings with Cuban American leaders and members of Congress since the protests swept through the island. Yotuel Romero, one of the performers of the song ""Patria y Vida,"" or ""Homeland and life,"" a phrase that was shouted repeatedly during the protests, will be at the meeting. ""Patria y Vida"" has become a sort of anthem in protests and is a play on the revolutionary slogan ""Homeland or Death."" Former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, eMerge Americas CEO and Roots of Hope founder L. Felice Gorordo and Miami Freedom Project co-founder Ana Sofia Pelaez are also expected to be in attendance.

The ships will leave the port of Veracruz in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, taking syringes, oxygen tanks and masks along with powered milk, cans of tuna, beans, flour, cooking oil and gasoline. The shipments exemplify Mexicos policy of ""international solidarity"" and it will keep offering humanitarian aid to help Latin American and Caribbean countries tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the foreign ministry said in a statement. The loading of the cargo began early on Thursday, said Marisa Lopez, a spokeswoman for the office of the mayor of Veracruz. The preparations came on the same day that the U.S. government announced sanctions against a Cuban security minister and a special forces unit for their alleged role in the crackdown on the anti-government protests that began this month. The Cuban embassy in Mexico City did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by decades-old U.S. embargo. Latin American governments have split along ideological lines over the protests in Cuba. Mexico, run by leftist Lopez Obrador, has sided with Cuba, while Chile and Peru have urged the Communist government to allow pro-democracy protests.

239,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-contests-claim-us-embargo-destabilizing-cuba-blockade-government,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, turned back claims by Democrats who followed Black Lives Matter and blamed the decades-long U.S. embargo on Cuba for sparking the recent historic protests. Rubio spoke from the Senate floor Tuesday, where he contended that people who called the embargo cruel either ""don't know what they're talking about,"" or are ""liars."" ""There is only one blockage in Cuba and it is the blockage that the regime has imposed on its people,"" Rubio said. WASHINGTON DC REMOVES 'CUBA LIBRE STREET PAINTING FROM IN FRONT OF CUBAN EMBASSY Earlier this month, pro-democracy protesters took to the streets across the island nation to call for human rights and basic necessities. Black Lives Matter posted a statement last week that blamed the U.S. embargo for the country's instability and credited the Cuban government for historically granting ""Black revolutionaries"" asylum. SCALISE SLAMS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR SENDING 'DISGUSTING MESSAGE TO CUBANS Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., was silent on the issue until Thursday when she issued a statement expressing ""solidarity"" with the Cuban people. She also called for the end of the 60-year-old embargo which she claimed, in part, ""profoundly"" contributed to the suffering of Cubans. On Tuesday, Rubio also criticized the decision by the Biden administration to review remittances to Cuba to ensure that money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. He also called on President Biden to listen to the people in Cuba and not the ""pro-regime people in your administration.""

240,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/21/reports-cuba-sentencing-up-30-protesters-time-summary-judgments/,"The human rights advocacy group Cuban Prisoners Defenders revealed Wednesday that it had received evidence the Castro regime is putting protesters on trial in groups as large as 30 people at once without allowing them access to a lawyer or proper legal safeguards. Thousands of people across the island of Cuba took to the streets on July 11 demanding an end to communism, a nationwide outcry that followed years of active, consistent organization by the islands largest dissident groups. Protests continued throughout last week; organizers announced a nationwide march by the mothers of those arrested on July 11 to begin on Wednesday morning. Cuban State Security agents began intensive campaigns last week to arrest and disappear protesters. In some cases, eyewitnesses and video footage proved that uniformed police officers were resorting to door-to-door raids, beating suspected protesters and opening fire on them despite no evidence that they presented any threat. Early estimates suggested police arrested or otherwise disappeared 5,000 people, though international human rights groups have been able to confirm only about 600 such arrests. Those known to be in police custody have begun the process of being charged with ""crimes"" for actions like marching along with protests in silence or recording footage of police brutality. According to Cuban Prisoners Defenders, the Communist Party is denying most protesters the right to an attorney and police -- not prosecutors -- are in charge of the process. Without prosecutors, no formal indictment process exists. ""The summary 'trials, with no lawyers or possible defense, are happening simultaneously in numbers of ten accused at a time, and we have even had knowledge of cases of 30 accused [processed] simultaneously,"" the organization denounced. ""We are talking about hundreds of people being processed, if not thousands. Extremely grave."" Cuban Prisoners Defenders has previously condemned the Cuban regime repeatedly for refusing the right to an attorney to political prisoners. It noted in a report this weekend, based on preliminary discussions with sources on the ground there, that the accused often have no way of knowing what crime they are facing trial for until minutes before their sentencing. ""From the time that police initiate an 'investigation to the trial, the majority of cases last between 48 and 96 hours,"" the organization reported. Cuba Decide, a pro-democracy advocacy group working in the country, has identified 642 individuals who have been either arrested or remain missing since participating in the July 11 protests. Of these, 526 people remain in custody or disappeared, while the remaining have been released. Some of the released remain either on house arrest or under strict government surveillance. Advocacy groups have identified at least ten children among the arrested and disappeared. Most of the families of those identified, all of them in their teens, do not know the whereabouts of their children or accusations against them, Cuban independent outlets have reported. Reports indicate that the Castro regime is also disproportionately targeting religious leaders. Among the arrested are the leaders of the Free Yorubas Association of Cuba, a group that practices the Afro-Cuban religion of Lucumi, or Santeria, outside of the auspices of the atheist Communist Party. ""On July 19, 2021, the District Attorney of Placetas, Villa Clara, charged three members of the Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba, along with nine other individuals, with public disorder, disobedience, spreading the epidemic, and incitement,"" the Global Liberty Alliance, which advocates for the safety and freedom of those under religious persecution, denounced Tuesday. ""The Free Yorubas charged, Loreto Hernandez Garcia, Donaida Perez Paseiro and Elizabeth Cintra Garcia, will be held in a provisional prison as a precautionary measure until a trial is held."" ""These provisional prisons allegedly conduct re-education programs for political prisoners,"" the group added. Hernandez Garcias brother, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez ""Antunez,"" told the Miami Herald that several of those arrested are parents to minor children who police left abandoned at home after abducting their parents. Antunez himself served a 17-year term in prison in Cuba from 1990 to 2007 over his anti-communist activism; he now resides in Miami. ""They told my nephew that his parents were under arrest and awaiting trial,"" Antunez noted, adding that State Security officers are striving to break into homes and arrest people in the loudest, most terrifying way possible to scare neighbors out of considering participating in protests. Catholic leaders have also suffered persecution. The most high-profile case during the current wave of protests has been that of Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, arrested on July 11 after receiving a beating that left him with a bloody head injury. Police released Alvarez the next day after an unlawful detention. The clergyman explained in a subsequent interview that he was arrested after asking police for help to reach the hospital, once he realized police had beaten him to the point where he was bleeding profusely from the head. ""I went to help him [the injured protester], to take him out of that atmosphere ... they beat me on the head. I would have been able to keep helping, but once I saw myself bleeding so much I knew I needed to go to the hospital,"" he narrated. ""I got to the I got close to the police, the only ones with a car, and asked them to take me. ... Once they healed me, they detained me and I was taken to a police station.""

241,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/21/poll-most-voters-blame-communism-cubas-problems/,"While some leftists in the United States have slammed the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba following country-wide anti-government protests on the island, most Americans think communism is to blame for the Cubas problems, according to a Rasmussen poll released Wednesday. The survey asked likely U.S. voters ""which is more to blame for the current problems in Cuba, the policies of the communist government there or the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba?"" Fifty-nine percent of voters said the communist government is at fault. Only 20 percent blamed the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba while 21 percent were not sure. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in more than 40 municipalities last week demanding the end of Fidel Castros 62-year communist regime. Protesters were caught on camera yelling slogans like ""down with communism,"" ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" among other anti-government statements. Notably, protesters were seen cloaked in American flags, embracing the United States rather than condemning it for its alleged embargo. ""Voters who blame Communism for Cubas problems more than the U.S. economic embargo are most likely to have followed news about the protests in the Caribbean island nation,"" according to the poll report. Seventy-three percent of voters who blame communism for Cubas problems said they have followed news about the protests in Cuba very closely. Echoing the respondents paying close attention, Republicans were more likely to blame communism than Democrats were. Sixty-seven percent of Republicans, 49 percent of Democrats, and 61 percent of voters not affiliated with either major party said the policies of the communist government in Cuba are responsible for the islands ills. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blamed the ""absurdly cruel"" U.S. embargo of Cuba last week for the nations turmoil, mirroring a statement from Black Lives Matter (BLM). BLM praised Cubas communist regime while also condemning U.S. government sanctions and asserting Cubans have chosen their own government. When asked, ""should refugees from Cuba be allowed into the United States?"" 59 percent of Democrats said yes compared to 48 percent of Republicans and unaffiliated voters. Overall, 52 percent of voters said refugees from Cuba should be allowed into the United States, while just 28 percent said the U.S. shouldnt admit Cuban refugees. Twenty percent 20 percent were not sure. The Biden administration warned Cuban refugees that they will be turned away if they flee to the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also threatened to arrest, incarcerate, impose excessive fines, and even take the vessels of boaters who help U.S.-bound Cubans flee the repression and economic suffering at the hands of the island nations communist regime. Meanwhile, the Biden administration relaxed security at the U.S.-Mexico border -- ""revoking most of his predecessors measures -- which Republicans and other critics blame for the record surge of migrants reaching the United States from the south in recent months,"" Breitbart News reported. Now, most Cubans seeking to enter the U.S. have to sneak across the border or claim asylum once they reach an official port of entry like many other Latin Americans. Many Cubans in the United States have strongly identified with or leaned toward the Republican Party for decades. The survey of 1,000 U.S. Likely Voters was conducted on July 15 and 18, 2021. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95 percent level of confidence.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/21/2021 20:21,Poll: Most Voters Blame Communism for Cuba's Problems,"['states', 'embargo', 'poll', 'communism', 'communist', 'problems', 'cuba', 'blame', 'cubans', 'cubas', 'economic', 'united', 'voters']","While some leftists in the United States have slammed the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba following country-wide anti-government protests on the island, most Americans think communism is to blame for the Cubas problems, according to a Rasmussen poll released Wednesday.

242,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-begins-handing-out-sentences-protesters-some-families-left-dark-2021-07-21/,"Actor and playwright Yunior Garcia, 38, talks to his girlfriend as he looks outside at men (not pictured) which he claims to be security agents who prevent him from leaving his home in Havana, Cuba July 20, 2021. Picture taken on July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, July 21 (Reuters) - An anti-government hip hop song by some of Cuba's most popular musicians in exile became the anthem of the unprecedented protests that rocked the Communist-run country last week. Now the visual artist who filmed the Cuban section of the videoclip for ""Patria y Vida"" ('Homeland and Life'), Anyelo Troya, 25, has been sentenced to a year in prison, according to relatives. He was charged with instigating unrest, they said, after attending a demonstration in Havana. Rights activists say this is just the start of what they predict will be a wave of summary trials of hundreds of people detained during and after the unusual protests on July 11 and 12 that the government has blamed on U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""They took him to trial without defense or lawyer or anything,"" Troya's mother Raisa Gonzalez told Reuters after witnessing his sentencing in what she called a collective trial of around a dozen people. The Cuban Foreign Ministry's International Press Center, which fields all requests from foreign journalists for comment from state entities, did not immediately reply to request for comment on the cases mentioned in this article. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday they had started the trials of those detained on charges of instigating unrest, committing vandalism, propagating the coronavirus pandemic, or assault, charges that could carry prison sentences of up to 20 years. ""There are people who will receive the response that Cuban legislation allows for, and it will be energetic,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on state television last week. He promised there would be due legislative procedure. But Gonzalez said she was not informed of her son's trial in time and when she arrived at the court with her lawyer, he had already been convicted. The trial was denounced by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) for taking place without proper defense or due process. Troya had already been under heightened vigilance for his participation in the song, whose headline is a twist on the revolutionary slogan 'Patria o Muerte' ('Homeland or Death'), his mother said. Javier Larrondo, a representative of the human rights organization Cuban Prisoners Defenders, said authorities would likely lock up the most charismatic and effective opposition leaders, who lately have often been young artists, whether or not they were at the protests. ""We will have hundreds of political prisoners in just two weeks,"" he said. The protests against Cuba's worst economic crisis in decades and curbs on civil liberties first erupted ten days ago in a small town before spreading throughout the country. By the evening of day two, they appeared to have dissipated amid heavy security operations and internet disruptions. The government blamed mercenaries exploiting frustrations with hardships caused by U.S. sanctions. Exiled rights group Cubalex, which has established a spreadsheet of those detained that it updates every day as new reports come in, says more than 500 Cubans appear to have been detained during the protests or afterwards. It said the tally was likely higher, but some families may fear reporting the arrest of relatives in case of reprisals such as losing their state sector jobs. Some of those detained, like theater director Yunior Garcia, have been released to house arrest. ""I have four officials in front of my door preventing me going out,"" Garcia told Reuters, which observed the officials. ""When I go to buy food or cigarettes, one of them goes with me to keep a close eye on me."" #SOS CUBA The majority of those detained have been kept incommunicado, while the location of some is still unknown, said Cubalex and HRW, based on interviews with relatives. Cubans have been posting photos of people they say they cannot locate or sharing stories of detentions on a Facebook group called 'Disappeared #SOSCuba' with more than 10,000 members. ""We went from police station to police station looking for her,"" said Alberto Betancourt of his sister, a stay-at-home mother-of-two who was detained at a protest in Havana. He located her after six days. ""They won't let me speak to her,"" he told Reuters, holding back tears. ""But she's not a criminal. She just let herself be swept up in the crowds."" Cuban interior ministry officials denied on Tuesday that anyone was missing and said a list of detainees circulating - they did not specify which - was manipulated and included people who were never detained. The detained include high profile dissidents like Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who also featured in ""Patria y Vida,"" and Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the country's largest opposition group. They also include ordinary citizens and bystanders, families and rights groups say. Many of those detained had been beaten or mistreated by security forces or rapid-reaction brigades - government-organized bands of civilian recruits, said HRW senior researcher Juan Pappier. Used to quiet streets, Cubans have been shocked over the last week by images of violence that have emerged on social media: security forces and bands of stick-wielding people in civilian garb beating protesters, as well as protesters throwing stones at police and overturning police cars. Diaz-Canel said last week ""maybe there will be a need for apologies to anyone who, in the middle of all the confusion, has been mistreated,"" and defended security forces' actions to re-establish ""peace.""

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - Katiuska Mustelier Sosa says her brother joined the protests in Cuba on July 11 and shares video of when he was last seen. Because she hasnt seen or heard from him, she fears he was seriously beaten. Enrique Mustelier Sosa, 38, a self-proclaimed member of the opposition, was detained that day in the city of Guantanamo. His sister says she gained the courage to come speak to Local 10 News on Wednesday not just because of her brother, but because of the hundreds of other Cubans who remain detained or missing after those massive protests. She is asking the international community to speak out on behalf of the Cuban people. South Florida Republicans also came together Wednesday, asking President Joe Biden to take action. ""The time to act is now,"" Miami-Dade Commissioner Rene Garcia said. Said Tom Powers, Broward GOP chairman: ""Dictatorships are great for politicians. Theyre not good for citizens. You need to step up."" Ad The group is highly critical of inaction by the White House, which they argue has only met with mostly members of the pro-engagement movement. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, says she is encouraged by what the president has done so far. But she also wants the White House to continue the conversation with exiles. ""That the president hear from a diverse set of voices,"" she said. Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Scott joined House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and several other lawmakers to send a letter to the leaders of the member nations of the Organization of American States and the European Union, as well as to other democratic nations and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging them to ""stand up and support the Cuban people in their fight for freedom.""

244,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bloodied-pro-cuba-demonstrator-slams-biden-cubans-dont-want-vaccines-they-want-freedom,"A Little Havana, Fla., demonstrator covered in theatrical blood; gagged, handcuffed and chained told ""Hannity"" on Wednesday that his attire is a euphemism for the plight of the Cuban people who have suffered under 62 years of dictatorship - as well as a cry for help to a president he said seems uninterested in supporting Cuban civilians' rights. The man, who did not give his name, spoke through ""Freedom""-embossed duct tape. ""These chains represent the dictatorship in Cuba. This blood represents the blood that is going to be on the hands of those who stand next to the dictatorship - and not next to the Cuban people,"" he said. MARCO RUBIO DEFENDS CUBA'S FIGHT AGAINST FAILED SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT: LEADERS ARE 'EVIL, 'INCOMPETENT ""Joe Biden, Cuba wants freedom,"" he said, addressing the president. ""They need freedom. They dont want vaccines, they don't want food, they need freedom: Thats what the Cuban people deserve, and thats what they want."" The man said the United States must stand with the civilians of Cuba and not with Miguel Diaz-Canel's autocratic rule, which he has held since younger Castro brother Raul, 90, ceded power to him in 2018. A woman standing next to the man in similar attire reiterated his call: ""The only vaccine the Cuban people need is freedom - please help!"" Host Sean Hannity turned to a delegation of Florida lawmakers standing beside him, and asked what they have heard or asked of the Biden White House in this regard. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a former Telemundo journalist who represents Miami Beach, Brickell, and the Little Havana neighborhood ""Hannity"" was visiting, said she has asked Biden for a meeting as many as ""three times a day"" to no response. ""We are very frustrated, we are very upset: because we have called respectfully and told Biden administration that this has nothing to do with political parties. He will not meet,"" she said. Salazar's seat is notable in that regard, as hers is one of few Democrat-majority districts that flipped Republican in 2020 - when the longtime news anchor defeated former Clinton Foundation President Donna Shalala. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who like Salazar is of Cuban ancestry, said that the world cannot forget the plight of the Cuban people, and that the activism in support of them ""cannot stop until Cuba is free and has liberty."" Miami Republican Mayor Francis X. Suarez added that the entire Western Hemisphere is impacted by the Cuban regime and its oppression. ""The Cuban people have no means to defend themselves,"" he said. ""It's so sad to see a lack of U.S. leadership."" HANNITY SHOWS SUPPORT FOR CUBA'S FIGHT FOR FREEDOM: 'THEY SHOULD BE LIVING IN PARADISE Demonstrators have flocked to the landmark Versailles Restaurant, at the corner of Calle Ocho and S.W. 36th Ave., where ""Hannity' was filming, for weeks now - in protest of Diaz-Canel's treatment of Cubans and in support of pro-democracy demonstrators now being targeted, arrested and punished by the regime. The Versailles corner has been a rallying point for the Cuban-American community for decades, as it is also where celebrations popped up in 2016, as demonstrators celebrated dictator Fidel Castro's death. The White House was criticized after press secretary Jennifer Psaki, in calling the regime a failure, remarked that ""a lack of access to economic opportunity, to medical supplies, to COVID vaccines"" are all reasons for the historic protests. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Critics countered that the true cause of the protests is the proliferation of Communism and left-wing governance on the island that has led to economic depression and recision of basic rights for the people of Cuba. In a statement on July 12, Biden said the White House ""stand[s] with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime.""",['Charles Creitz'],7/22/2021 0:37,"'Bloodied' Little Havana demonstrator slams Biden: 'Cubans don't want vaccines, they want freedom'","['bloodied', 'havana', 'president', 'demonstrator', 'need', 'vaccines', 'white', 'biden', 'slams', 'cuban', 'support', 'regime', 'dont', 'cuba', 'freedom', 'cubans', 'hannity', 'little']","MARCO RUBIO DEFENDS CUBA'S FIGHT AGAINST FAILED SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT: LEADERS ARE 'EVIL, 'INCOMPETENT""Joe Biden, Cuba wants freedom,"" he said, addressing the president.

(AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) Special forces police patrol the streets as they drive past a large Cuban flag hanging from the facade of a building, in Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, July 21, 2021. (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba criticized the United States and President Joe Biden on Wednesday for a series of statements by senior officials after the unprecedented protests on the island last week, accusing the U.S. government of seeking to justify a military intervention. Johana Tablada, deputy director for U.S. affairs at Cubas Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said U.S. officials are painting a false picture of the situation in Cuba, which is struggling with severe economic problems amid a surge in coronavirus infections. ""There is a Walt Disney narrative of a bad government and people fighting for their freedom -- stereotypes that scare anyone who has never set foot in Cuba, because of their arrogance and disregard for the truth,"" Tablada said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""They are very interested in fabricating an alternative reality because the riots of July 11 werent enough to justify the war that is being waged on us,"" she added. ADVERTISEMENT Communicating via social networks, thousands of Cubans took to the streets July 11 in various parts of the country to voice complaints over power cuts, long lines at stores, shortages of goods and rising prices, while some called for changes in the government. The protests ended in acts of vandalism, destruction of patrol cars, stone throwing at hospitals and looting. There were also violent arrests of protesters by the police, witnessed by AP, and according to authorities one death. Officials have not released a list of prisoners, but Human Rights Watch said in a reported Wednesday that about 500 had been arrested. The day before, Col. Victor Alvarez at the Ministry of the Interior said that some detainees had been released when there wasnt enough evidence to prove they participated in protests, but others were being processed by the judicial system. He did not give any numbers or other details. The protests were the largest in more than two decades, while groups of government supporters also took to the streets, including tens of thousands on Saturday. Authorities suspended cellphone internet data service on the island, charging that a campaign orchestrated from the United States used robot messaging on Twitter and other social media to instigate the demonstrations. Officials also insisted that U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration are responsible for the islands shortages of food, medicine and fuel. A petition on the Change.org platform created by a citizen in Belgium asking for the U.S. government to invade Cuba has been signed by almost 500,000 people, and some Florida politicians have raised such an action as a possibility. Tablada said that while there are no current U.S. military movements aimed at Cuba, there are signs of extreme aggressiveness, such as those that led to an interventions in Libya and Iraq. ADVERTISEMENT ""We are at a time when discourse has deteriorated to unprecedented levels,"" she said. ""From the Biden government in regards to Cuba, we have seen parading several times a day, every day since July 11, senior United States officials saying things that are not true"" about Cuba. Biden promised during his election campaign that he would resume President Barack Obamas policy of rapprochement with the island, but after entering the White House, he kept in place all the toughened sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump, including adding Cubas government to a list of sponsors of terrorism. The White House has said a working group has been told to review the U.S. policy blocking Cuban Americans from sending money to Cuba but to ensure that the Cuban government does not serve as intermediary in the flow of cash. Washington says it is also considering increasing the staff at its embassy in Havana to facilitate the participation of civil society. Cuba is going through one of the worst economic crises in its history, a mixture of its own inefficiencies, the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact from U.S. sanctions.",['Andrea Rodriguez'],7/22/2021 0:46,Cuba: US protest narrative paving way for military incursion,"['narrative', 'streets', 'states', 'sanctions', 'president', 'protest', 'military', 'cuban', 'ap', 'protests', 'way', 'incursion', 'cuba', 'officials', 'paving', 'united']","Special forces police patrol the streets as they drive past a large Cuban flag hanging from the facade of a building, in Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, July 21, 2021.

Ron DeSantis slammed the Biden administration Wednesday, saying it is not doing enough to help the Cuban people following protests against Havanas Communist regime last week. During an appearance on Fox News ""Hannity"" from Miamis Versailles Restaurant, DeSantis called on Biden to ""step up and be on the side of freedom."" The governor repeated his insistence that the White House help provide internet access on the island after the Cuban government shut down social media sites at the height of the protests. ""The internet access is something we have the capability of doing. We have companies in the US that want to do it, but they need the OK of the federal government,"" DeSantis said. ""He [Biden] has it within his authority to do that. He can make it happen, and if hes willing to do that, I think it would make a positive difference. ""As it stands now, hes basically just sitting there doing nothing,"" the governor added. ""Hes leaving these folks out to dry, and whats gonna end up happening, if they dont get any type of assistance, is the regime will continue to clamp down, and theyll eventually stamp this out and then theyll remain even stronger in power, and that will be a huge blow to the cause of freedom."" Cubans are seen outside of Havanas Capitol in a demonstration against their government on July 11, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island on July 11 to demand an end to 62 years of Communist rule in the biggest protests in nearly three decades. Hundreds have been detained in the subsequent crackdown. The Cuban government has acknowledged the death of one protester, but opposition sources say the number is higher. Last week, Biden described Cuba as a ""failed state"" and communism as a ""universally failed system"" and added that his administration was ""considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate"" internet access on the island. President Joe Biden released a statement during protests, which called on the regime in Cuba to ""hear their people."" AFP via Getty Images However, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), accused Biden of refusing to meet with them to discuss next steps. ""Were very frustrated. We are very upset, because we have called respectfully and we have told the Biden administration this has nothing to do with political parties,"" Salazar, whose district includes Miamis Little Havana, told host Sean Hannity. ""He will not meet with us."" ""Weve asked for meetings,"" Rubio concurred. ""It hasnt happened so far."" Salazar charged that Biden ""is not paying attention to those people that are screaming on the streets of Havana, 'Libertad! Theyre not saying 'Down with the embargo or 'We want more vaccines or 'We want more food. No, theyre saying 'we want freedom ... The Biden administration needs to pay attention to us."" Rubio went on to suggest that addressing the situation in Cuba ""is not a priority"" for the White House. ""You have to understand, theres a segment of his voting base that actually thinks the regime is good, that actually brags about the regime,"" the senator said. ""People that openly say it. I mean, the Black Lives Matter Foundation said it. And I said, 'Thats great. My office will help the Black Lives Matter Foundation immigrate to Cuba.'"" Despite the ongoing crackdown, Rubio insisted that the Communist government ""has been mortally wounded. Its lost its legitimacy. ""Im not telling you its gonna be quick and its gonna be easy, but its a dying animal and we need to do everything we can to expedite its passing.""",['Social Links For Samuel Chamberlain'],7/22/2021 4:21,Florida Republicans call on Biden to 'step up' in wake of Cuba protest,"['havana', 'wake', 'republicans', 'protest', 'florida', 'rubio', 'biden', 'hes', 'help', 'regime', 'protests', 'internet', 'cuba', 'saying', 'administration', 'step']","Ron DeSantis slammed the Biden administration Wednesday, saying it is not doing enough to help the Cuban people following protests against Havanas Communist regime last week.

He can make it happen, and if hes willing to do that, I think it would make a positive difference.

247,https://www.breitbart.com/news/us-sanctions-cuba-for-repressing-protests-biden-warns-more-to-come/,"The United States imposed sanctions on Cubas defense minister and a special forces unit Thursday for repressing peaceful protests, a step President Joe Biden warned is ""just the beginning"" of punitive measures against Havana. The US Treasury Department said its Office of Foreign Assets Control froze the assets of minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Special National Brigade (SNB), a division of Cubas interior ministry, in relation to human rights abuses committed during a crackdown on protests on the island earlier in July. ""This is just the beginning -- the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said in a statement. The sanctions were imposed under the Magnitsky act, which allows a US president to take action against human rights abuses and corruption. Biden said his administration targeted Lopez Miera and the SNB -- a special forces unit nicknamed the Black Berets -- because they were ""driving the crackdown"" against protesters who took to the streets by the thousands in rare public demonstrations against the communist government. ""As we hold the Cuban regime accountable, our support for the Cuban people is unwavering,"" Biden said. The president also condemned what he called ""the mass detentions and sham trials"" used to imprison and silence outspoken Cubans. Cuba pushed back swiftly, calling the sanctions ""slanderous"" and saying the United States should focus more on repression and police brutality on its own soil. ""I reject unfounded and slanderous sanctions by the US government"" against the Cubans targeted, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter. The sanctions freeze all Lopez Miera and SNB assets and interests in the United States, as well as prohibit any US citizen, resident or entity from engaging with them financially. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Biden, for his part, said Washington was considering multiple new steps. The United States is working closely with regional partners like the Organization of American States ""to pressure the regime to immediately release wrongfully detained political prisoners, restore internet access and allow the Cuban people to enjoy their fundamental rights,"" he said. Washington is also reassessing its policy guiding remittances to Cuba, with the State Department expressing concern that such funds could ""find their way into Cuban government coffers,"" according to spokesman Ned Price. Washington will ""continue to review what more we can do"" to support the Cuban people while holding the nations authorities to account, Price said. 'Weak response On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""Were hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. According to the Treasury Department, Cubas defense ministry and security services attacked people and ""arrested or disappeared over 100 protesters in an attempt to suppress these protests."" The demonstrations have further strained an already tense relationship between Washington and Havana. Cuba has seen a whiplash in US policy in recent years, with former president Barack Obama normalizing relations at the end of his term, declaring that a half-century of efforts to topple the regime had failed, and then his successor Donald Trump reimposing sweeping economic pressure. Biden as president had exhibited a go-slow approach to Cuba, but the unrest has thrust the relationship into a spotlight. Several US lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, applauded the administrations sanctions. For some Republicans it was not enough. Senator Roger Wicker tweeted on Thursday he was ""disappointed in the weak response from (Biden) and @StateDept as the Cuban people cry out for help.""",[],7/22/2021 13:52,"US sanctions Cuba for repressing protests, Biden warns more to come","['sanctions', 'states', 'president', 'warns', 'treasury', 'special', 'come', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'regime', 'protests', 'cuba', 'repressing', 'united']","The United States imposed sanctions on Cubas defense minister and a special forces unit Thursday for repressing peaceful protests, a step President Joe Biden warned is ""just the beginning"" of punitive measures against Havana.

248,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-impose-sanctions-cuban-officials-over-crackdown-protests-source-2021-07-22/,"WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on a Cuban security minister and an interior ministry special forces unit for alleged human rights abuses in a crackdown on anti-government protests earlier this month. The move marked the first concrete steps by President Joe Biden's administration to apply pressure on Cuba's Communist government as it faces calls from U.S. lawmakers and the Cuban-American community to show greater support for the biggest protests to hit the island in decades. The speed with which the administration has crafted new sanctions further signals Biden is highly unlikely to soften the U.S. approach to Cuba any time soon after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era detente with Havana. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""This is just the beginning,"" Biden said in a statement, expressing condemnation for ""mass detentions and sham trials."" ""The United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" he said. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, in a message on Twitter, rejected the sanctions as ""unfounded and slanderous"" and urged the United States to apply such measures to its own record of ""daily repression and policy brutality."" The Treasury Department said the sanctions had been placed on an entire Interior Ministry security unit and on General Alvaro Lopez Miera, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, describing him as leader of an entity ""whose members have engaged in serious human rights abuse."" Thousands of Cubans staged protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has brought shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Hundreds of activists were detained. Biden had promised during the 2020 campaign to reverse some of Trump's Cuba policies, but Thursday's announcement suggests little appetite for a return to rapprochement. At the same time, the administration is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people. The White House said on Tuesday that Biden would form a working group to examine remittances to Cuba in the wake of the protests. The aim is to determine how Cuban-Americans can send money to families on the island while keeping the funds out of the hands of the Cuban government. A Cuban flag hangs over a street in downtown Havana, Cuba, July 15, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Trump had imposed tight restrictions on remittances, which are believed to have previously amounted to several billions of dollars annually. The White House, in a statement, cautioned that the remittances issue was complex and ""requires a measured and thoughtful approach in coordination with experts."" Biden reiterated on Thursday that his administration is looking for ways to help ordinary Cubans regain internet access after Havana restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook (FB.O) and WhatsApp. ""We will work closely with our partners throughout the region, including the Organization of American States, to pressure the regime,"" Biden said. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. GLOBAL MAGNITSKY SANCTIONS The sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, used to punish human rights violators with U.S. asset freezes and bans on travel to the United States. But U.S. officials have acknowledged that Cuban officials rarely have U.S. financial dealings and seldom travel to the United States, limiting the practical impact of such measures. The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency into Biden's broad Cuba policy review, which began shortly after he took office in January. Until now, Cuba had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad. Cuba, a State Department official told Reuters, is now a ""top priority."" Analysts say conciliatory moves are unlikely in the near term. Complicating matters was Biden's poorer-than-expected showing with voters in south Floridas anti-communist Cuban-American community, which backed Trumps tough policies toward Havana and Caracas and helped him win the battleground state. Many analysts say Biden may have to tread carefully on Cuba policy ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.

250,https://nypost.com/2021/07/22/mccarthy-huddles-with-gop-to-push-biden-on-cuba-strategy/,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy huddled with members of the House GOPs 16-member Cuba advisory group Wednesday to discuss policy options to aid Cuban protesters pushing back against the Communist regime to hold it accountable. The group is weighing its legislative options, with members asserting they are looking to work across the aisle and with the Biden administration to ramp up pressure on Cuba to allow for peaceful protesting in the face of violence and repression from Cuban officials. Following the advisory groups first meeting, McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he plans to hold meetings in Miami, where members can hear from experts and people impacted by the human rights abuses. ""Weve got a lot of different ones that we were going to move forward on. First thing were going to do, too, is, you know, we sent a letter to all the ambassadors, weve got a letter to the president, [on] actions that we think need to take place,"" McCarthy told The Post. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy huddles with GOP lawmakers to discuss Cuba. Caleb Smith ""We want to make sure to invite Democrats to join us, were going to do a complete conference policy meeting next week to educate everybody the places [were] going, and were talking about putting a meeting together down in Miami."" Some of the islands largest protests in recent history have emerged in the wake of food, medicine, electricity and internet shortages. And lawmakers in the group have vowed to do all in their power to help secure freedom in the country. McCarthy announced earlier this month he tapped GOP Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Salazar of Florida, Nicole Malliotakis of New York, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, Puerto Rico Delegate Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes and Ken Calvert of California, Mark Green of Tennessee, Hal Rogers of Kentucky, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Chris Smith of New Jersey, House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul and House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Kay Granger of Texas, and Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington to serve on the panel, which was formed shortly after the demonstrations began to heat up.

Ron DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio for a town hall on Fox News ""Hannity"" Wednesday night to call on the Biden administration to do more to help the Cuban people following protests against Havanas Communist regime last week. She and Rubio accused Biden of refusing to meet with them to discuss next steps. ""Were very frustrated. We are very upset, because we have called respectfully and we have told the Biden administration this has nothing to do with political parties,"" Salazar, whose district includes Miamis Little Havana, told host Sean Hannity. ""He will not meet with us."" ""Weve asked for meetings,"" Rubio concurred. ""It hasnt happened so far."" Malliotakis said she is encouraged by the Biden administrations talk of new sanctions, but feels it needs to be acting more swiftly to aid in securing the internet on the island so its people can communicate and get their message out. ""Were coming up with action items that we think that the Biden administration should be taking to try to advance the cause of the Cuban people who want freedom. We are disappointed with the response from the Biden administration thus far,"" she said. The New York Republican, who was briefed by the State Department along with a handful of other members, said she was encouraged the administration indicated it would not lift the embargo, arguing lifting it would ""only further prop up the regime that is weakened right now."" She added that there are existing bipartisan measures she would like to see move in the House. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel speaks during an act of revolutionary reaffirmation in Havana, on July 17, 2021.

And the second thing is to really push democracies, freedom-loving countries from around the world to join and to push in a united effort to rid the island of this illegitimate regime and bring freedom and democracy to the island,"" she continued. ""We have a number of bipartisan resolutions. I have introduced a bipartisan resolution, also [Rep. Debbie] Wasserman [Schultz (D-Fla.)] has introduced a resolution and so far it has not come up for a vote and were hoping that its going to come to the Foreign Affairs Committee for a vote,"" she said. ""It shouldnt be hard to stand on the side of freedom and to condemn a brutal, murderous regime."" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) said she is encouraged by the Biden administrations talk of new sanctions. Getty Images A number of progressives including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- both socialists -- have slammed the embargo, with Sanders tweeting that it has ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" But GOP lawmakers blasted their argument, asserting that the Cuban regime controls how much money and what resources are made available to its citizens. ""When you hear Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and others talk about lifting the embargo, they [Cuba] do business with nearly every other country in the world and nothing gets to the people, any of the money, any of the medicine,"" Malliotakis said. Green echoed her calls for the embargo to remain intact. ""Well, we obviously have to keep the embargo in place, I mean 90 percent of the economy in Cuba is run by military holding companies. So, any lifting of the embargo just empowers the regime more,"" he said. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has slammed the embargo. Getty Images Green said one option they could move forward with is a resolution calling for the people of Cuba to be allowed to have a First Amendment. One potential avenue lawmakers have weighed advocating is pushing for the creation of a back channel to be able to communicate with allies in Cuba in a similar fashion to the system the Trump administration pursued with allies in Iran. McCaul, who has been vocal in pushing back against the Cuban regime, stressed the importance of ensuring internet access is available to allow Cubans to fight for their freedoms, noting legislation he and Sen. Masha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) have worked on in an attempt to ensure access to open communication is available. ""The Open Technology Fund, which Senator Blackburn and I authorized, has helped to fund technology that is currently circumventing Chinese-supported censorship in Cuba,"" he said. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) stressed the importance of ensuring internet access is available to allow Cubans to fight for their freedoms. Getty Images ""Our estimates are nearly 1.3 million Cubans have access to the internet because of initiatives supported by the Open Technology Fund. We need more tools like the Open Technology Fund to support people around the world who are fighting for their freedom, like the people in Cuba."" Gimenez said helping seek technological solutions is a key component in aiding Cuban protesters in being able to protect themselves from violence and add transparency to the situation on a broader platform. ""We want the people of Cuba to be able to communicate with themselves, and also with the outside world. We think that thats a very, thats really a very important aspect of this, because this was all organic,"" he said. ""So we think that the Cubans, what they did is they tried to shut that down, and they have. So if we re-establish it, then organically the Cubans can again start to organize, and then also can protect themselves somewhat from the brutality of the regime by videoing, and then also sending those signals."" Biden called for the State Department to establish a working group on Monday that would be tasked with examining remittances in an attempt to ensure money being sent to relatives in Cuba is received by the proper individuals and not seized by the regime.",['Social Links For Juliegrace Brufke'],7/22/2021 16:51,McCarthy huddles with GOP to push Biden on Cuba strategy amid historic protests,"['embargo', 'mccarthy', 'biden', 'huddles', 'push', 'amid', 'protests', 'regime', 'cuba', 'cuban', 'administration', 'strategy', 'gop', 'internet', 'world', 'house', 'going', 'historic']","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy huddles with GOP lawmakers to discuss Cuba.

251,https://nypost.com/2021/07/22/biden-to-sanction-cuba-officials-over-protest-crackdown-report/,"President Biden has authorized US sanctions against one Cuban official and a Cuban government agency in the wake of a crackdown on antigovernment protests. The sanctions target Cuban Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Interior Ministrys special forces brigade, nicknamed the ""Black Berets."" Biden said in a statement that ""my Administration is imposing new sanctions targeting elements of the Cuban regime responsible for this crackdown -- the head of the Cuban military and the division of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior driving the crackdown -- to hold them accountable for their actions."" ""This is just the beginning - the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said. But the sanctions against the Black Berets arent new, the Treasury Department noted in a press release. Former President Donald Trump imposed sanctions against the entire Cuban Interior Ministry, including the brigade, in January, and it does not appear that those sanctions were lifted by Biden. It was not immediately clear why Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who called the protesters ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"" and oversaw the crackdown, is not facing sanctions.

We will be battling in the streets,"" the Cuban leader reportedly said while urging pro-communist Cubans to counter-protest White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at her daily press briefing Thursday that ""we of course condemn mass detentions, sham trials and disappearances that are attempts to threaten the Cuban people into silence."" Critics have called on Biden to act amid the crackdown this month on protesters, who condemned communist leaders while protesting food shortages and a lack of COVID-19 vaccines. Although US sanctions can be a major inconvenience by freezing the use of bank accounts, credit cards and other financial services, Cuba is largely detached from the international financial system -- with salaries averaging $44 per month -- and its unclear what practical effect the new sanctions will have on Lopez Miera and the Black Berets. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel (second from left) promised he would ""battle in the streets"" to stop protesters.

YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images Biden said last week that the US is investigating whether its technically possible to override an internet blackout imposed by communist authorities on the island. The lack of internet access prevents distribution of information on protests. Former President Donald Trump was able to boost support for Republicans among Latinos last year by claiming that Democratic policies could turn the US into a larger version of Cuba or Venezuela. Biden last week denounced communism -- and said socialism wasnt much better, despite an increasing number of Democrats who self-identify as socialists -- when he was asked by a reporter to respond to the Cuba protests. But Republicans called on him to do more to support the activists in Cuba. ""As it stands now, hes basically just sitting there doing nothing,"" Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) said this week. ""Hes leaving these folks out to dry, and whats gonna end up happening, if they dont get any type of assistance, is the regime will continue to clamp down, and theyll eventually stamp this out and then theyll remain even stronger in power, and that will be a huge blow to the cause of freedom.""",['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],7/22/2021 17:38,Biden sanctions Cuban official over protest crackdown,"['sanctions', 'president', 'interior', 'getty', 'protest', 'biden', 'week', 'cuban', 'press', 'official', 'crackdown', 'miguel', 'protesters']","President Biden has authorized US sanctions against one Cuban official and a Cuban government agency in the wake of a crackdown on antigovernment protests.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration announced new sanctions Thursday against a Cuban official and a government special brigade that it says was involved in human rights abuses during a government crackdown on protests on the island earlier this month. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control listed Alvaro Lopez Miera, a Cuban military and political leader, and the Brigada Especial Nacional del Ministerio del Interior, or Interior Ministry Special Brigade, as among those who will face the latest sanctions. Treasury said in a statement that Lopez Miera ""has played an integral role in the repression of ongoing protests in Cuba."" Cubas Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, which is led to by Lopez Miera, and other Cuban governments security services have attacked protesters and arrested or disappeared over 100 protesters in an attempt to suppress these protests, according to Treasury. The regime led by Miguel Diaz-Canel moved quickly, and violently, to stem the protests. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the actions by Cuban authorities, and violent mobs it mobilized, ""lay bare the regimes fear of its own people and unwillingness to meet their basic needs and aspirations."" ADVERTISEMENT The Interior Ministry Special Brigade was already sanctioned in January by the Trump administration, which targeted the entire ministry and Interior Minister Lazaro Alberto Alvarez Casas under the Global Magnitsky Act. ""I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. ""The Cuban people have the same right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as all people."" The move comes after the White House earlier this week announced that Biden had ordered his administration to take several steps to raise pressure on the communist regime after thousands of Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island earlier this month to protest food shortages and high prices during the coronavirus crisis. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez immediately took to Twitter to call the sanctions ""baseless and slanderous"" and suggested that Biden apply the sanctions on himself ""for acts of everyday repression and police brutality"" in the U.S. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control had been tasked with exploring sanctioning Cuban officials who committed human rights violations against peaceful protesters in Cuba. ""The Cuban people are protesting for the fundamental and universal rights they deserve from their government,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime."" Biden has also called for the State Department to launch a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. Biden also ordered a review of the viability of increasing staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The White House is hopeful that a boost in staffing could help it better facilitate civil society engagement following one of Cubas biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory. ""Weve made clear over the last week that addressing this moment was a priority for the administration and for President Biden,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. --- Associated Press writer Andrea Rodriguez in Havana.","['Aamer Madhani', 'Matthew Lee']",7/22/2021 17:43,US imposes new Cuba sanctions over human rights abuses,"['sanctions', 'rights', 'imposes', 'treasury', 'white', 'abuses', 'biden', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'human', 'secretary', 'press', 'ministry']","FILE - In this May 7, 2021, file photo Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington.

WASHINGTON - The United States imposed sanctions on Cuba's defense minister and the communist nation's special forces brigade for the suppression of peaceful protests that broke out on the island last week. The sanctions mark the first steps by the Biden administration to apply pressure on the Cuban government as Washington faces calls to show greater support for the protesters. President Joe Biden warned the Cuban government that there will be more to come. ""This is just the beginning - the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" the president said in a statement Thursday. Previously, Biden said the U.S. stands ""firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights."" The Treasury Department singled out Cuban Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera, for having ""played an integral role in the repression of ongoing protests in Cuba."" The sanctions prohibit payments from entities in the United States to Lopez Miera and the special forces, as well as payments from the Cuban entities to the U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday that the U.S. was working with the private sector and Congress to look for ways to make the internet accessible to the people of Cuba. Price has previously called on the Cuban government to restore full internet and telecommunications. ""The actions of Cuban security forces and violent mobs mobilized by Cuban Communist Party First Secretary Miguel Diaz-Canel lay bare the regime's fear of its own people and unwillingness to meet their basic needs and aspirations,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a statement. ""We stand with every Cuban seeking a government that respects the human rights and dignity of the Cuban people,"" he added. Over a week ago, thousands of protestors filled the streets over frustrations with a crippled economy hit by food and power shortages. The rare protests, the largest the communist country has seen since the 1990s, come as the government struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic, pushing the island's fragile health-care system to the brink.",['Amanda Macias'],7/22/2021 17:55,U.S. sanctions Cuban officials over crackdown on protests as Biden warns: 'This is just the beginning',"['sanctions', 'beginning', 'states', 'warns', 'special', 'biden', 'communist', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'officials', 'crackdown', 'united', 'forces']","Special forces troops patrol at Prado Avenue following the protests in Cuba, Havana on July 21, 2021.

The United States imposed sanctions on a senior Cuban security official and an interior ministry brigade following a crackdown on anti-government protests earlier this month, the US Treasury Department announced Thursday. The move marks the first concrete steps by President Joe Bidens administration to apply pressure on the Cuban government as the United States faces calls from US lawmakers and the Cuban-American community to show greater support for the protesters. ""This is just the beginning,"" Biden said in a statement. ""The United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people."" ""I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence,"" said Biden. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, ""Weve made clear over the last week that addressing this moment was a priority for the administration."" The Treasury Department named 78-year-old Cuban national Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Interior Ministry as targets of the sanctions. US President Joe Biden had promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to reverse some of Trumps anti-Cuba policies, but Thursdays announcement suggests little appetite for a return to rapprochement [Maria Alejandra Cardona/Reuters] Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, in a message on Twitter, rejected the sanctions as ""unfounded and slanderous"" and urged the United States to apply such measures to its own record of ""daily repression and policy brutality."" I refute the unfounded & slanderous US gov. sanctions against Army Corp Gral Alvaro Lopez Miera and the National Special Brigade. It should rather apply unto itself the Magnitsky Global Act for systematic repression & police brutality that took the lives of 1021 persons in 2020. -- Bruno Rodriguez P (@BrunoRguezP) July 22, 2021 The speed with which the Biden administration has crafted new sanctions further signals the US president is highly unlikely to soften his countrys approach to Cuba anytime soon after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era effort to thaw relations with Havana. Thousands of Cubans staged spontaneous anti-government protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has brought shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Many activists were arrested. Biden had promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to reverse some of Trumps anti-Cuba policies, but Thursdays announcement suggests little appetite for a return to rapprochement. Cubans have been posting photos of people they say they cannot locate or sharing stories of detentions on a Facebook group called 'Disappeared #SOSCuba with more than 10,000 members. [Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo] Trump had imposed severe restrictions on the flow of remittances, which are believed to have previously amounted to several billions of dollars annually. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on US-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by US sanctions. On Tuesday authorities confirmed they had started the trials of those detained on charges of instigating unrest, committing vandalism, propagating the coronavirus pandemic, or assault, charges that could carry prison sentences of up to 20 years. ""There are people who will receive the response that Cuban legislation allows for, and it will be energetic,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on state television last week. He promised there would be due legislative procedure. Javier Larrondo, a representative of the human rights organisation Cuban Prisoners Defenders, said authorities would likely lock up the most charismatic and effective opposition leaders, who lately have often been young artists, whether or not they were at the protests. ""We will have hundreds of political prisoners in just two weeks,"" he said. Demonstrators chanting during a rally outside the White House in Washington [Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo] Exiled rights group Cubalex, which has established a spreadsheet of those detained that it updates every day as new reports come in, says more than 500 Cubans appear to have been detained during the protests or afterwards. It said the tally was likely higher, but some families may fear reporting the arrest of relatives in case of reprisals such as losing their state sector jobs. The majority of those detained have been kept incommunicado, while the location of some is still unknown, said Cubalex and Human Rights Watch, based on interviews with relatives.

256,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/us-imposes-new-cuba-sanctions-over-human-rights-abuses-n1274765,"WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration announced new sanctions Thursday against a Cuban official and a government entity that it says was involved in human rights abuses during a government crackdown on protests on the island earlier this month. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control listed Alvaro Lopez Miera, a Cuban military and political leader, and the Brigada Especial Nacional del Ministerio del Interior, or Interior Ministry Special Brigade, as among those who will face the latest sanctions. In a statement, President Joe Biden said the sanctions were ""just the beginning"" of measures to hold those responsible for the crackdown accountable. ""I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence,"" Biden said. The U.S. would work with regional allies to continue to support the Cuban people, the president added. That includes working with civil society groups and the private sector to provide internet access that circumvents government censors and reviewing U.S. policy on remittances, which were curtailed under the Trump administration. The U.S. is also committed to restaffing the embassy in Havana to provide consular services to Cubans, Biden said. The Interior Ministry Special Brigade was already sanctioned in January by the Trump administration, which targeted the entire ministry and Interior Minister Lazaro Alberto Alvarez Casas under the Global Magnitsky Act. ""Weve made clear over the last week that addressing this moment was a priority for the administration and for President Biden,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The move comes after the White House announced earlier this week that Biden had ordered his administration to take several steps to raise pressure on the communist regime after thousands of Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island earlier this month to protest food shortages and high prices during the coronavirus crisis. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control had been tasked with exploring sanctioning Cuban officials who committed human rights violations against peaceful protesters in Cuba. Other steps included the State Department creating a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. Biden also ordered a review of the viability of increasing staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The White House is hopeful that a boost in staffing could help it better facilitate civil society engagement following one of Cubas biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory.",['The Associated Press'],7/22/2021 18:36,U.S. imposes new Cuba sanctions over human rights abuses,"['sanctions', 'havana', 'rights', 'imposes', 'interior', 'saidthe', 'president', 'white', 'abuses', 'biden', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'house', 'human', 'ministry', 'administration']","WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration announced new sanctions Thursday against a Cuban official and a government entity that it says was involved in human rights abuses during a government crackdown on protests on the island earlier this month.

257,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-sanctions-cuba-crackdown-protests-1st-steps-policy/story?id=78993718,"In his first steps toward his own Cuba policy, President Joe Biden is sanctioning the Cuban defense minister and its special forces for the aggressive crackdowns on protests across the island nation earlier this month, the White House announced Thursday. Those protests were some of the largest and most widespread in decades as Cuba reels from a new wave of the coronavirus, the economic pain of COVID-19, and shortages of food and medicine. They also short-circuited Biden's administration into a response. Six months into his term, Biden has yet to formulate a policy toward America's close neighbor after his former boss Barack Obama warmed relations with Cuba's communist government and his immediate predecessor Donald Trump all but cut contact and implemented the toughest sanctions and restrictions. ""This is just the beginning - the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said in a statement Thursday, demanding the government ""immediately release wrongfully detained political prisoners, restore internet access, and allow the Cuban people to enjoy their fundamental rights."" The Treasury Department announced that it sanctioned Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Brigada Especial Nacional, the government's special forces unit within the Interior Ministry that was deployed ""to suppress and attack protesters,"" according to the agency. The new sanctions are not likely to inflict any new pain in Havana beyond the decades-old embargo, but they send a clearer message about where Biden will stand after Obama's rapprochement and Trump's heavy penalties. The Cuban Foreign Ministry has not yet responded, but government leaders including President Miguel Diaz-Canel repeatedly blamed the U.S. government or the Cuban diaspora in Miami for stirring up the protests. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. While he helped Obama's efforts to ease tensions with Cuba and reopen trade and travel, Biden has kept most of Trump's sanctions and restrictions in place so far as his administration completes his review. Beyond Thursday's sanctions, the administration announced other baby steps in staking out its own Cuba policy earlier this week, including creating a working group to study the issue of remittances -- the money that Americans, especially Cuban Americans, send back to the island. Remittances were severely restricted by the Trump administration, which said they were largely lining the pockets of the Cuban government as it charged large fees for their transmission. The limits imposed by Trump led Western Union, the financial services company, to close its operations in Cuba. Biden's new working group will look for ways to allow money to flow to the Cuban people without enriching the Cuban government, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. Biden had said last week that he would not ease those Trump-era restrictions, but administration officials denied they were backing away from that pledge, noting that the president said during a press conference that it was ""highly likely that the regime would confiscate those remittances or a big chunk of it."" ""Thats certainly something that we're mindful of and we're looking at. That will be a point of discussion in these working groups,"" Psaki said Tuesday. State Department spokesperson Ned Price added that there's no amount of Cuban government collection on remittances that would be ""acceptable to us"" but declined to get ahead of what the working group may decide. He also announced that the State Department will launch its own review about adding staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana. Only a skeleton crew works there now after Trump's first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson drew down embassy staff after the first reports of medical incidents sometimes known as ""Havana syndrome"" emerged publicly. ""The staffing at our embassy will serve to enhance our diplomatic, our engagement - our diplomatic activity, our engagement with civil society, our consular service engagement, all of which will be in service of helping the Cuban people to secure greater degrees of human rights, of freedom, of the universal rights that have been denied to them for far too long,"" Price said Tuesday. He declined to provide any timeline on when staffing changes could be made or speak to any changes in security after those ""unexplained health incidents,"" as the department calls them, that cause ""Havana syndrome"" -- except to say safety will be a top consideration in this review.","['Abc News', 'Conor Finnegan', 'July']",7/22/2021 18:51,US sanctions Cuba over crackdown on protests in 1st steps toward new policy,"['sanctions', 'havana', 'steps', 'policy', '1st', 'trumps', 'biden', 'cuban', 'department', 'protests', 'cuba', 'crackdown', 'administration', 'announced', 'working']","In his first steps toward his own Cuba policy, President Joe Biden is sanctioning the Cuban defense minister and its special forces for the aggressive crackdowns on protests across the island nation earlier this month, the White House announced Thursday.

259,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/22/us-cuba-sanctions-protests-human-rights,"The US has imposed sanctions on a Cuban security minister and an interior ministry special forces unit for alleged human rights abuses in a crackdown on anti-government protests this month. The move marked the first concrete steps by Joe Bidens administration to apply pressure on Cubas Communist government as it faces calls from US lawmakers and the Cuban American community to show greater support for the biggest protests to hit the island in decades. The speed with which the administration has crafted new sanctions further signals Biden is highly unlikely to soften the US approach to Cuba any time soon after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era detente with Havana. ""This is just the beginning,"" Biden said in a statement, expressing condemnation for ""mass detentions and sham trials"". ""The United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" he said. The Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, in a message on Twitter, rejected the sanctions as ""unfounded and slanderous"" and urged the US to apply such measures to its own record of ""systematic repression and police brutality"". The treasury department said the sanctions had been placed on an entire interior ministry security unit and on Gen Alvaro Lopez Miera, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, describing him as leader of an entity ""whose members have engaged in serious human rights abuse"". Thousands of Cubans staged protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has brought shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Hundreds of activists were detained. Biden had promised during the 2020 campaign to reverse some of Trumps Cuba policies, but Thursdays announcement suggests little appetite for a return to rapprochement. At the same time, the administration says it is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people. The White House said on Tuesday that Biden would form a working group to examine remittances to Cuba in the wake of the protests. The aim is to determine how Cuban Americans can send money to families on the island while keeping the funds out of the hands of the Cuban government. Trump had imposed tight restrictions on remittances, which are believed to have previously amounted to several billions of dollars annually. The White House, in a statement, cautioned that the remittances issue was complex and ""requires a measured and thoughtful approach in coordination with experts"". Biden reiterated on Thursday that his administration was looking for ways to help ordinary Cubans regain internet access after Havana restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp. ""We will work closely with our partners throughout the region, including the Organization of American States, to pressure the regime,"" Biden said. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls US-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. The sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, used to punish human rights violators with US asset freezes and bans on travel to the US. But US officials have acknowledged that Cuban officials rarely have US financial dealings and seldom travel to the US, limiting the practical impact of such measures. The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency into Bidens broad Cuba policy review, which began shortly after he took office in January. Until now, Cuba had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad.",[],7/22/2021 19:36,US sanctions Cuban security chief and special forces over crackdown on protests,"['chief', 'security', 'sanctions', 'rights', 'special', 'biden', 'cuban', 'minister', 'protests', 'imposed', 'cuba', 'remittances', 'crackdown', 'administration', 'forces']","The US has imposed sanctions on a Cuban security minister and an interior ministry special forces unit for alleged human rights abuses in a crackdown on anti-government protests this month.

261,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/22/time-to-end-plague-of-communism-republicans-call-for-criminal-tribunal-of-human-rights-abuses-in-cuba/,"More than 140 Republican lawmakers led by Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sent a letter to the Organization of American States, the E.U., and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday demanding action against Cubas communist regime -- including an international criminal tribunal. The letter read: After more than six decades of brutally oppressive rule, the Cuban people are risking their lives to loudly denounce the disastrous communist regime that has time and time again failed to promote and protect the general welfare of its citizens. It is time to finally end the evil and murderous reign of the communist, illegitimate Cuban regime that has murdered, tortured and oppressed for far too long. The letter comes a week after Cubas largest anti-government protests in decades broke out in more than 40 municipalities on the island. Protesters were met with gunfire and beaten in the streets. Independent media in Cuba estimated that as many as 5,000 people have been arrested or disappeared since protests began, Breitbart News reported, though the names of only about 600 individuals are confirmed. Current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued last week. In the letter, lawmakers suggested an international criminal tribunal be established to investigate Cubas alleged crimes against humanity. Lawmakers named organizations like Justice Cuba, Cuba Archives, and the Cuban American Bar Association, which ""have already been compiling the names and crimes of those who have committed human rights abuses."" The Justice Cuba International Commission previously presented testimony from former political prisoners who witnessed torture and atrocities perpetrated by the Cuban government. As Breitbart News previously reported, Justice Cuba compiled legal evidence and completed its investigation into Cubas human rights abuses in 2018. At the time, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) urged former President Donald Trumps administration to indict former Cuban dictator Raul Castro, but action was never taken. Since then, the organization has been in search of a tribunal in order to ""successfully try Cuban government officials accused of torture and other atrocities against the population on the island."" ""We encourage you to work with us in forming an International Criminal Tribunal for Cuba for crimes against humanity and work to hold the Communist regime accountable,"" lawmakers said in the letter. In addition to a tribunal, Republicans want the international community to ""immediately end diplomatic relations"" and ""end all financial support to the regime."" The letter continued: A full withdrawal of financial support by the international community will end a critical lifeline that allows the Cuban regime to maintain its tight grip on power. Any nation that stands for freedom, democracy and human rights cannot also continue to support the communist Cuban regimes brutal oppression with appeasement policies in the form of increased trade, tourism, extensions of credit or investments in joint ventures with the regime. Republicans slammed the ""failed appeasement policies of the Obama-Biden administration"" which ""did nothing to promote freedom for the Cuban people or end the oppression forced on them by Cubas malevolent dictatorship."" Lawmakers said, ""it only emboldened the regime and funded its campaign of oppression."" ""All money that goes into Cuba through any trade, tourism or commercial relationship directly enriches the regime,"" lawmakers said in the letter. Lawmakers additionally asked the international community to work collaboratively to coordinate democratic assistance for the ""brave Cuban freedom advocates,"" and emphasized the importance of giving Cubans Internet access to communicate with the outside world. Social media allowed information and photos of the Cuba protests to widely circulate, enabling thousands of Cubans to join in before the regime shut down Internet access on the island. The letter continues: A primary weapon of dictatorships like the Cuban regime is silencing their opposition: they stop them from talking to each other, from receiving information from those around the world who want to help them, and from getting the images of the regimes oppression to the outside world. Overall, lawmakers said the 62-year-old regime, the oldest dictatorship on the Western Hemisphere, has remained in tact long enough without being held accountable: Its time to end this terrible plague of communism on the Cuban people. Its time for freedom and democracy to prevail. We urge you to stand up for a free Cuba and show your commitment to freedom with immediate action to support their cause. The time for democracy in Cuba is now. The request for action comes as Democrats and Republicans spar over how to handle Cuba. Many Democrats have sought to blame the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba for the islands problems, while most Republicans and protesters blame Cubas corrupt Communist government. After more than a week of inaction, President Joe Biden on Thursday announced that the U.S. will sanction ""one Cuban individual and one Cuban entity for serious human rights abuse."" His administration is also reportedly working with the private sector to figure out how to restore Internet to the island and will restaff the U.S. Embassy in Havana (where several ambassadors were mysteriously sickened), among other measures.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/22/2021 22:47,Republican Lawmakers Call for Tribunal of Human Rights Abuses in Cuba,"['end', 'rights', 'letter', 'tribunal', 'abuses', 'communist', 'cuban', 'lawmakers', 'regime', 'republican', 'cuba', 'freedom', 'human', 'cubas', 'international']","It is time to finally end the evil and murderous reign of the communist, illegitimate Cuban regime that has murdered, tortured and oppressed for far too long.

262,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2021/07/22/cuba-police-rip-people-off-sidewalks-to-block-protest-by-political-prisoner-mothers/,"An attempt to hold nationwide marches Wednesday to demand the Cuban Communist Party reveal the whereabouts and health status of hundreds, if not thousands, of people arrested and disappeared on July 11 prompted heavy police presence and ""preemptive"" arrests of people suspected to be attending. Thousands of protesters organized dozens of local marches throughout the island of Cuba on July 11 demanding an end to the communist regime. The earliest reports of protests on that day came from San Antonio de los Banos, a Havana suburb, but spread all the way to Santiago de Cuba on the other side of the island. Holguin and Camaguey, eastern Cuba, documented some of the largest peaceful marches anywhere in the country. Despite the protests being overwhelmingly peaceful - and the Cuban population not enjoying the right to bear arms - the Communist Party responded to the protests with extreme repression. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead representing the Castro family regime, delivered remarks on national television urging civilians to commit violent assaults on people suspected to be ""counter-revolutionaries."" Diaz-Canel described his command as an ""order of combat."" In addition to encouraging vigilante violence - and, evidence suggests, organizing armed civilian gangs to attack suspected dissidents - the Castro regime engaged in mass arrests, public beatings, and disappearances of dissidents. Cuba Decide, a human rights advocacy group, has confirmed the arrests or disappearances of 667 people nationwide since July 11, of which 526 remain in police custody. This does not include people under house arrest - including many prominent independent journalists, prevented from doing their jobs - and experts say the number is artificially deflated by the difficulty of reaching some parts of remote Cuba. The true number, advocates say, could be in the thousands. To raise awareness of the mass arrests, the Movement of July 11 Mothers, a group founded to organize the families of the imprisoned and disappeared, called for a protest beginning at 11 a.m. on Wednesday nationwide. The group used word of mouth - the government shut down the internet after the protests - to urge peaceful marches in every city in the country demanding only to know the fates of their children. It actively encouraged only mothers of those arrested to participate; supporters were told to line the streets, not march. The Movement of July 11 Mothers adopted the same tactic used by one of Cubas largest dissident groups, the Ladies in White - a coalition of mothers, wives, sisters, and brothers of political prisoners beaten and arrested during the Black Spring communist crackdown of 2003. While many of those imprisoned in 2003 have since been released, the Ladies in White have continued their singular act of protest every week: wearing white and carrying images of their loved ones, attempting to attend Catholic Mass in silence. The Castro regime forced the Catholic Church during the Obama era to ban the women from attending Mass. To prevent the creation of a second Ladies in White phenomenon, the Castro regime flooded Havana with police cars Wednesday and actively arrested people suspect of planning to attend any anti-government marches. Dissidents managed to record the arrest of two such people and smuggle the video out of Cuba. Marthadela Tamayo and Osvaldo Navarro were walking down the street, apparently peacefully, when state security agents intercepted and arrested them, based on no apparent criminal activity. No evidence exists that the agents had a warrant against them or reason to believe they were a threat to society. The couple were, however, on their way to the meeting point of the July 11 Mothers march. Navarro himself took the video. The video shows police officers intercepting the couple. Navarro can be heard repeatedly asking of police, ""dont touch her,"" referring to Tamayo, then asking, ""where are we going?"" Police do not respond and at no point appear to explain why the couple is being taken into custody. Diario de Cuba, which reported details of the video arrest, noted that its own journalist ""Jorge Enrique Rodriguez"" was ""intercepted"" on his way to the marchs meeting point and threatened with arrest if he did not immediately return home and stay there. At least one other journalist, Juan Manuel Moreno, was arrested along with his wife Zelandia de la Caridad for attempting to attend the march. ""They have state security forces along with auxiliary forces from the Ministry of the Interior blocking roads to prevent the protest,"" activist Juan Antonio Madrazo told the Miami-based AmericaTeVe of Havana. Madrazo also confirmed the authenticity of the above arrest video and noted that many who wished to attend the protests endured similar repression. The Communist Party of Cuba has plainly denied the existence of any political prisoners or disappeared protesters. ""In Cuba, There Are No Disappeared or Tortured People,"" a headline in Granma, the official newspaper of the Party, read Wednesday. The denial echoes a remark by dictator Raul Castro during a press conference alongside then-President Barack Obama in 2016, in which he replied to a question about the fate of the islands political prisoners by CNN reporter Jim Acosta. ""What political prisoners?"" Castro replied. ""Give me a list of the political prisoners and I will release them immediately."" Multiple human rights groups indeed produced a list of prisoners of conscience in Cuba, which Castro then ignored.",['Frances Martel'],7/22/2021 23:42,Cuba: Police Arrest Mothers of Political Prisoners to Block Protest,"['prisoners', 'video', 'protest', 'mothers', 'arrest', 'regime', 'castro', 'protests', 'cuba', '11', 'arrested', 'political', 'block']","The Castro regime forced the Catholic Church during the Obama era to ban the women from attending Mass.

MIAMI - A small group of protesters met Friday morning at a marina behind Bayside before they headed toward Cuba. The group left shortly before 8 a.m., and will stop in Key West to refuel before making their way toward the island. The protesters who planned the event want to show their support for the Cuban people who are going through a humanitarian crisis. They want to show their solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who continue to protest on the island, calling for an end to the decades-old communist regime. ""Its super important because Im Cuban. You know, I left when I was 13 years old, so its super important and just like all of them, supporting my family, supporting, you know, the people in Cuba,"" one boater said while pointing to the other boaters who had gathered. The group isnt trying to take anything to the island, but are doing this strictly to show support for people in Cuba. ""We want the Cuban community to see us and see that were there to help them out,"" Osdany Veloz said. Ad One Cuban woman, Elizabeth Cintra Garcia recorded video of herself before she presented herself at a military unit after she was cited following those widespread protests two weekends ago on the island. A group of protesters met Friday morning at a marina behind Bayside as they plan to head 12 miles off the shore of Cuba. Her mother says Cintra Garcia remains detained in a womens prison in Santa Clara, charged with disrespect of authorities, epidemic spread, public disorder and inciting others to protest. Reports continue to come out of Cuba that protesters are being sentenced to jail without just trials. Cintra Garcias mother said she has no words to express her pain as her 20-year-old daughter is now awaiting trial simply for protesting the government. Shes calling on the international community to speak up on behalf of all the young people in Cuba who will be unjustly prosecuted. In her video, Cintra Garcia said if anything happens to her, she blames the Cuban government. ""I was born in Cuba and my family is Cuba and I just hurt for the Cuban people,"" explained Luis Machado of SOS Cuba Flotilla. ""I just want to help get their message out there."" Ad ""Everybody is trying something different, a different way of getting to the media, and this is the other way to get to the media. We need to be heard, the Cuban people need to be heard,"" he added. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard will be checking the South Florida protesters boats by air and water, but will not be escorting them toward the island. ""We are not escorting folks and we have had zero permits submitted for anyone to cross into Cuban territorial waters,"" Petty Officer Nicole Groll, of the U.S. Coast Guard, told Local 10 News. ""So essentially, these folks are going boating, and theyre going boating together and from what I understand (its) a small group, and if they go into international waters, thats up to them. As long as they do not cross into Cuban territorial waters, nothing they are doing is illegal."" The group plans to stay on idle surrounding the island and at sunset, they will light up the sky with Chinese lanterns, fireworks and flares to let the island nation know theyre in support of their cause. Ad ""Theyre gonna physically see the fireworks, theyre going to physically see the boats there, so I think its going to be something that is very strong and very powerful for them,"" Veloz said. Groll said the Coast Guard is urging the boaters to save their flares for an emergency situation. Coast Guard volunteer, Jim Gillernan, inspected the boats before they headed out. ""Where these boats are going is into the straits of Florida, and those folks that have been into the straits of Florida know the straits of Florida can be a pretty treacherous body of water pretty quickly,"" said Gillernan. The Coast Guard will monitor their voyage and will be on stand-by in case of an emergency. ""Once we get to international waters, were going to wait until the sun goes down to be able to launch some flares, some fireworks, and be seen,"" Veloz added. An avid boater told Local 10 News that it takes four to five hours to get from Miami to Key West by boat, and then, depending on the boat, about four hours or more to get from Key West to Cuba. Ad The group expects to arrive 15 nautical miles outside of Havana by 5:30 p.m. and will head back to Key West at sunset. ""My message to the Cuban people is to stay strong, keep fighting for your rights and Cuba libre hopefully soon,"" Veloz said. Machado added, ""Family members came here on a raft. You know, the least we could do, weve waited for a perfectly calm day."" ""Were here to keep them fighting because if you guys stop reporting, this its all going to go away, and theyre going to win, and thats sad, really sad,"" he said.","['Annaliese Garcia', 'Christian De La Rosa']",7/23/2021 10:56,"South Florida boaters head toward Cuba, will light up sky in support of island's citizens","['south', 'islands', 'cuban', 'group', 'veloz', 'head', 'sky', 'florida', 'boaters', 'cuba', 'guard', 'going', 'support', 'light', 'west', 'waters', 'citizens', 'protesters', 'know']","A small group of protesters met Friday morning at a marina behind Bayside before they headed toward Cuba.

265,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/23/cuba-police-threaten-hospitalized-teen/,"The parents of a 16-year-old currently recovering from a gunshot wound incurred in a police interaction during the July 11 protests in Cuba said on Thursday that state security agents had visited the boy without parental consent in his hospital room to threaten him with prison time. The teen, identified as Yoel Misael Fuentes Garcia, was shot in the leg in La Guinera, a neighborhood of Havana, while attempting to approach the sounds of a tumultuous crowd he would later come to know were protesters. According to Diario de Cuba, which interviewed his step-father, Fuentes was not actively participating in anti-government protests but simply went outside to investigate the loud noises he could hear from his home. Thousands of Cubans are believed to have taken the streets on July 11 to call for an end to the 62-year-old Castro regime. While some of the largest protests, like the one Fuentes encountered, occurred in Havana, dozens of cities nationwide reported peaceful marches and assemblies in public calling for freedom from the Communist Party. The protests were the culmination of mounting unrest during the past decade when a Castro regime emboldened by concessions under President Barack Obama greatly increased repression of dissidents, artists, and others who threatened to challenge the party line in public. Janoi Ceballos, Fuentes stepfather, told Diario de Cuba that communist authorities did not allow the boys family into his hospital room but did allow police officers to enter the room to threaten him with prison time. ""We, the relatives, had to see Yoelito through a glass in the hospital. Meanwhile, a police officer went directly to his bed to interrogate and coerce him,"" Ceballos said. ""He told him that they could take him to 100 y Aldabo."" 100 y Aldabo is one of Cubas most notorious prisons. Survivors of the prison have accused Cuban authorities of psychologically and physically torturing inmates; it has maintained a reputation for decades of being the prison where authorities send prisoners they wish to ""break"" to testify against others. Ceballos emphasized that no evidence supports any claim that his stepson participated in the protests or engaged in any criminal activity. Protests - or any publicly expressed sentiment - against the regime in Cuba often result in criminal charges such as ""disorderly conduct"" or the uniquely Cuban crime of desacato (""disrespect""). ""Police, attempting to disperse the protest, shot all the time against unarmed protesters. My stepson got hit in the leg and he will recover, but another person there died, his mother is doing very poorly,"" Ceballos added. ""Until now, no authority at any level has come to offer an apology for hurting my stepson, which would be the minimum they should do since he ... just got close out of curiosity to see what was happening."" Fuentes has since been discharged from the hospital. The casualty toll of the July 11 protests - and subsequent protests occurring throughout the country on a nearly daily basis since then - remains largely a mystery as the Castro regime has shut down the internet nearly nationwide, imprisoned and assaulted journalists, and otherwise impeded human rights groups from keeping a tally. Officially, the regime claims only one person, Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, died in the protests. Police reportedly shot Tejeda dead in the back. Dissident organizations on the island and families of those affected have managed to help international groups keep a better estimate of the number of imprisoned and disappeared Cubans since protests began. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), an NGO operating out of Spain, revealed on Friday that as of that day, it has confirmed the arrests of 757 people across the island. Of these people, 13 are believed to be children. The group noted that it had made ample use of social media video to confirm many of the arrests and lamented that the Castro regime had shut off the internet, making those videos harder to obtain, during a press conference on Friday. It added that a nationwide manhunt continues for participants in the protests still at large. Evidence from relatives following the ordeals of the protesters suggests that none can expect fair judgment under the law. Cuban Prisoners Defenders, an NGO that documents the malignant use of the law on the island to repress dissenters, revealed this week that the Castro regime is denying most protesters basic due process rights like the right to an attorney or the right to know what crime they are being charged with in a reasonable amount of time. ""The summary 'trials, with no lawyers or possible defense, are happening simultaneously in numbers of ten accused at a time, and we have even had knowledge of cases of 30 accused [processed] simultaneously,"" the organization denounced. ""We are talking about hundreds of people being processed, if not thousands. Extremely grave."" The longest processed cases, the group noted, have lasted only about 96 hours from arrest to conviction.

266,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/23/biden-sanctions-cuba-protest-crackdown/,"The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions against Cuban security minister Gen. Alvaro Lopez Miera and a security unit of the Cuban Interior Ministry for their role in cracking down on protesters. The sanctions were denounced as ""unfounded and slanderous"" by the Cuban regime, and as ""symbolic but meaningless"" by critics such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who noted Miera is already under sanctions. Biden sanctioning an already sanctioned regime official in #Cuba is the kind of symbolic but meaningless measure we will continue to see as long as @potus is being advised by people who were drinking mojitos in Havana in 2015 to celebrate the Obama policy#CubaLibre -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 23, 2021 ""The actions of Cuban security forces and violent mobs mobilized by Cuban Communist Party First Secretary Miguel Diaz-Canel lay bare the regimes fear of its own people and unwillingness to meet their basic needs and aspirations,"" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken when announcing the sanctions on Thursday. ""Today, the United States is imposing sanctions on Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Cuban Ministry of the Interiors Special National Brigade or 'Boinas Negras (Black Berets),"" Blinken said. ""Lopez Miera and the Special National Brigade have been involved in suppressing the protests, including through physical violence and intimidation."" Miera and the Black Berets were added to the U.S. Treasury Departments list of ""specially designated nationals"" under the Global Magnitsky Act, which authorizes sanctions against foreign nationals for corruption and human rights abuses. ""The Cuban people are protesting for the fundamental and universal rights they deserve from their government,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime."" President Joe Biden said the sanctions are ""just the beginning"" and the U.S. will ""continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people."" ""The Cuban people have the same right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as all people. The United States stands with the brave Cubans who have taken to the streets to oppose 62 years of repression under a communist regime,"" Biden said. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez responded on Twitter, calling the sanctions ""unfounded and slanderous"" and suggesting the U.S. government should punish itself for ""systematic repression and police brutality that took the lives of 1021 persons in 2020."" Rodriguez threatened the U.S. with ""grave consequences"" for its ""irresponsible conduct."" The Black Berets have been caught on video using excessive violence against peaceful protesters. One woman provided video of Black Berets shooting her husband and carting him off in a wheelbarrow while their children watched. Another woman said her son, an independent journalist named Henry Constantin, was arrested while covering the protests and taken to his home by the Black Berets so they could confiscate his computers and other equipment. Constantins colleagues say he and his producer and editor have been taken to a detention facility known as ""the place where everyone sings"" due to its ""methods of greater severity in interrogations."" Cuban democracy activists said the regime shut down power and Internet service so it would be harder for victims of the Black Berets to upload footage of the brutal units human rights abuses. The UK Daily Mail on Thursday quoted skeptics who said the Biden administrations tepid action would have little practical effect on the Cuban regime or its stormtroopers, beyond mildly embarrassing the Black Berets and making them wonder if they might be held personally accountable for their actions: Giancarlo Sopo, who was rapid response director for Spanish-language media on President Trumps re-election campaign, said: 'US law already prohibits transactions with the Cuban military. The Cuban military does not have property in the US. But a Cuban-American lawyer, speaking on anonymity because of the sensitivity of sanctions cases, said the repercussions of such a public naming and shaming would be felt in a country that relies on anonymity and a 'just following orders mentality. 'As a practical matter theres little that will change in their financial life, he said. 'But put yourself in their shoes, you have have now been identified in a very public way. As Sen. Rubio pointed out, the entire Cuban Interior Ministry was already targeted for sanctions by the Trump administration under the Global Magnitsky Act in January, including the Black Berets. Under the Trump sanctions, ""all property and interests in property"" of the ministry and its leader, Lazaro Alberto Alvarez Casas, was frozen. ""U.S. officials have acknowledged that Cuban officials rarely have U.S. financial dealings and seldom travel to the United States, limiting the practical impact of such measures,"" Reuters noted on Thursday.",['John Hayward'],7/23/2021 20:02,'Symbolic but Meaningless': Biden Sanctions One Person in Cuba,"['sanctions', 'treasury', 'berets', 'biden', 'cuban', 'regime', 'miera', 'cuba', 'person', 'symbolic', 'ministry', 'united', 'black', 'meaningless']","The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions against Cuban security minister Gen. Alvaro Lopez Miera and a security unit of the Cuban Interior Ministry for their role in cracking down on protesters. The sanctions were denounced as ""unfounded and slanderous"" by the Cuban regime, and as ""symbolic but meaningless"" by critics such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who noted Miera is already under sanctions. The United States stands with the brave Cubans who have taken to the streets to oppose 62 years of repression under a communist regime,"" Biden said.

The Communist government of Cuba cut Internet access on the island in response to protests that began that day, preventing protesters from communicating or organizing as the political uprising for freedom continues. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not have an update to the presidents claim last Thursday that he was exploring the possibility of the United States intervening by offering restored Internet access to the country. ""Theyve cut off access to the Internet,"" Biden said during a press conference last week. ""Were considering whether we have the technology to reinstate that access."" Biden spoke about the idea after Governor Ron DeSantis and other Florida Republicans sent a letter urging him to explore options. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth, and if we are able to help Cubans communicate with one another and with the outside world, that truth is going to matter,"" DeSantis wrote. But Biden still has not acted. When asked for an update to the presidents promise -- and if the administration would consider using high-tech balloons to provide Cubans with Internet access, Psaki replied, ""I wish it was that easy."" ""We are exploring a range of options. We are quite focused and interested in restoring internet access to the people of Cuba,"" she added. Psaki did not explain why the United States had not yet acted to help Cubans restore Internet access, but endorsed the idea. ""We feel if we could get it done it would be a great step forward and beneficial to the people of Cuba,"" she said. Biden faces continued criticism for being too slow to react to Cubas protests and remaining unwilling to act definitively to assist the movement. Former President Donald Trump criticized Bidens reaction to the protests during an interview with Telemundo. ""I think hes from a different planet; he doesnt understand the plight of the people of Cuba,"" Trump said, referring to Biden. ""What this administration is doing is just going to prolong it [the Castro regime].""",['Charlie Spiering'],7/23/2021 20:55,WH Offers No Update on Biden Proposal to Restore Cuba Internet,"['wh', 'access', 'exploring', 'proposal', 'biden', 'internet', 'protests', 'truth', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'offers', 'united', 'update', 'restore']","President Joe Biden is still exploring options to restore Internet access to Cuba after the regime shut it down on July 11, the White House claimed on Friday.

Martha Acosta, mother of 38-year-old plastic artist Carlos Gonzalez Acosta, told The Associated Press that her son was sentenced to 10 months in prison on Tuesday for public disorder. She said she wasnt able to attend the trial in Havana because she was not informed of it until it was over. ""It doesnt seem fair to me. My son has no record, he is not a criminal,"" said Acosta. She said the family will appeal the sentence before a tribunal. After being sentenced, Gonzalez was sent to the Havanas Valle Grande jail. He is only one of an unspecified number of people arrested after the July 11 protests, when thousands of Cubans took to the streets of the capital and other cities to protest food shortages and high prices during the pandemic. ADVERTISEMENT The Cuban government hasnt said how many were detained, but some NGOs, like Human Rights Watch, have made public lists with the names of more than 500 people allegedly arrested or missing. Amid the criticism, the U.S. government on Thursday reinforced sanctions on some Cuban officials. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control listed Alvaro Lopez Miera, Cubas Minister of the Armed Forces, and the Brigada Especial Nacional del Ministerio del Interior, or Interior Ministry Special Brigade, as among those who will face the latest sanctions. Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Bruno Rodriguez has denied there are people missing or that detainees are being mistreated, saying authorities are only applying the law. Meanwhile, Interior Ministry Col. Victor Alvarez said on Thursday that families have been informed of their relatives legal situations. Yoel Gonzalez Acosta, Carlos brother, told the AP that after almost a week and a half they have not been able to see him or speak to him. Other Cubans have been telling similar stories of people already sentenced or with surveillance outside their homes. Cuban film producer Claudia Calvino said on her Facebook page that photographer Alexander Diego Gil was sentenced to 10 months in prison for public disorder, and family members of visual artist Anyelo Troya said he was also found guilty and he will have to spend a year in jail. Another plastic artist, Julio Llopiz-Casal, who was part of the protests, told the AP that he is at his house, but theres an official in plain clothes in front of it, and he has decided not to leave it.",['Andrea Rodríguez'],7/23/2021 21:05,Relatives: Cubans arrested after protests face summary trial,"['interior', 'trial', 'artist', 'sentenced', 'acosta', 'protests', 'summary', 'face', 'relatives', 'cubans', 'arrested', 'gonzález', 'told', 'public']","HAVANA (AP) -- Relatives and friends of Cubans arrested during the unprecedented recent protests on the island said authorities are carrying out summary trials at a time when Cubas government is receiving criticism from international groups and governments, including the U.S., for its crackdown on the demonstrations.

MIAMI, Fla. - One day after the White House imposed sanctions on the Cuban government, people marched on Calle Ocho Friday. Yet another show of solidarity with the people of the island following weeks of historic protests. Following the newly announced sanctions on Cuba, we talked to political analyst Sasha Tirador, who participated in a White House call before sanctions were announced Thursday. ""We are not doing things off the cuff. We are listening to your voices. There are many more meetings pending,"" Tirador says was the biggest takeaway from the call. Tirador, who identifies her political affiliation as Democrat, says she believes a military intervention is just not doable. ""People who criticize what the Biden administration did yesterday do not realize how much political capital the president is spending on this,"" she said. Tirador feels that this is a time for action and the latest sanctions show that the president is interested in effecting change in Cuba. Ad But others believe the sanctions wont drastically change the situation. Andy S. Gomez, former University of Miami professor and author of the book ""Social Challenges Facing Cuba,"" said that the Biden administration missed a golden opportunity in the days following the Cuba protests. ""Its nothing more than to try and appease a segment of the Cuban-American community that was calling for him to do more."" Now the White House, he said, is trying to stop the bleeding. ""You are trying to put a Band-Aid on a cut that is 15-inches long when you really need stitches. Those marching in Little Havana said the sanctions are not enough. Alexander Perez /Kiwanis Club of Little Havana No food, no medicine. And the people arent even asking for that. They are asking for liberty and for freedom,"" said Alexander Perez of the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana. ""Thats the ultimate goal. I think that thats what the president should focus on and this administration has the power to change the outcome of Cuba."" Ad Meanwhile, many people are also wondering when the international community will step in.",['Hatzel Vela'],7/24/2021 1:35,"Cubans in Miami have opposing views on U.S. sanctions, some saying it's not enough","['sanctions', 'president', 'white', 'change', 'cuba', 'views', 'cubans', 'house', 'political', 'administration', 'opposing', 'saying', 'little', 'miami', 'tirador']","MIAMI, Fla. - One day after the White House imposed sanctions on the Cuban government, people marched on Calle Ocho Friday.

KEY WEST, Fla. - Organizers of a flotilla originally expected dozens of boaters to join them Friday on an ambitious journey, but they only ended up with half a dozen. Osdany Veloz was on one of six boats -- part of the SOS Cuba flotilla. ""Theres people that have messaged me from Cuba, so they are expecting us over there,"" Veloz said. Speaking of the handful of boats in the flotilla to Cuba, he said, ""We were expecting a lot more people. Im not going to lie to you."" Sky 10 cameras were rolling as they sailed out of Bayside in Miami early Friday morning. And Local 10 News cameras were at the scene in Key West where the small flotilla stopped to fuel and undergo a voluntary inspection before starting their voyage. They wanted to get as close to Cuba as they were legally allowed, which is some 15 nautical miles off the shore of the island nation. ""Were not going to get into their waters,"" Veloz said. U.S. Coast Guard volunteer Jim Gillerman explained, ""Where these boats are going is into the straits of Florida. Folks that have been into the straits of Florida know the straits of Florida can be a pretty treacherous body of water pretty quickly."" Ad The mission of the boaters is to be seen by the Cuban people, the thousands that have been hitting the streets protesting against their Communist regime. ""I feel happy, scared, but its a journey to show our Cuban people over there that we are behind them,"" said Dayani Diaz, who was on one of flotilla boats. The U.S. Coast Guard said they would monitor the voyage and will be on standby in case of an emergency, but they are not escorting them. ""I was born in Cuba and my family is Cuba and I just hurt for the Cuban people and I just want to help get their message out there,"" said Luis Machado, part of the SOS Cuba Flotilla. Cuban government officials reacted to the planned trip and warned the White House to seriously act to avoid any incidents. Members of the flotilla planned on setting off fireworks in hopes that people in Cuba would see them. But that was something the U.S. Coast Guard was concerned about. Flares sent into the air are usually a signal to the Coast Guard that a boat is in distress. Ad As of 11:15 p.m. Friday, the flotilla had not returned.",['Christian De La Rosa'],7/24/2021 3:33,Small flotilla leaves Miami headed to waters off island of Cuba as show of support,"['straits', 'boats', 'small', 'florida', 'support', 'cuban', 'waters', 'flotilla', 'island', 'cuba', 'coast', 'veloz', 'leaves', 'guard', 'going', 'miami', 'headed']","A half a dozen boats headed towards Cuba Friday in a show of support to the people protesting Communism on the island.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini MOSCOW, July 24 (Reuters) - Russia has sent a shipment of coronavirus-related humanitarian assistance to Cuba, including 1 million medical masks, the defence ministry said on Saturday, adding President Vladimir Putin had given instructions for the aid. Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, earlier this week reported the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare anti-government protests earlier this month on the Communist-run island. Two military planes carrying 88 tonnes of aid - including food and personal protective equipment, including over 1 million medical masks, departed from an airfield near Moscow on Saturday, the defence ministry said in a statement. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""On the instructions of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, military transport aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the Republic of Cuba,"" the ministry said. The ministry did not mention the United States, but with its aid to longstanding ally Havana, Russia could also be looking to make a point against Washington. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by decades-old U.S. embargo. Government critics say the island's economic woes are caused largely by the inefficiencies of the state-run system. Mexico said on Thursday it would send to Cuba two navy ships loaded with medical and food supplies, including syringes, oxygen tanks and masks, along with powered milk, cans of tuna, beans, flour, cooking oil and gasoline. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has blamed the U.S. embargo for fomenting the unrest in Cuba. With a population of 11 million, Cuba reported nearly 4,000 confirmed coronavirus cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average, in an outbreak fuelled by the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant on the island.

272,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/24/nearly-60-prosecuted-over-cuba-demonstrations-says-top-official,"Hundreds were arrested during protests this month and many face charges of contempt, public disorder and vandalism. Nearly 60 people have been prosecuted in relation to unprecedented anti-government protests that broke out in Cuba earlier this month, a senior Cuban official has said, vowing that due process was being followed amid international criticism. The cases were over minor charges, and the total number of people detained has not been released amid complaints from relatives seeking information about loved ones. ""Until yesterday, 19 judicial processes had reached the municipal courts of the country - cases involving 59 people accused of committing alleged crimes (during) these disturbances,"" Ruben Remigio Ferro, president of the Supreme Court, told reporters on Saturday. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in several locations, including the capital Havana, on July 11 and 12 to demand government action amid an economic crisis and food shortages made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. The protesters shouted ""Freedom"", ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""Were hungry"" in what were the largest protests on the island in decades. Reed Lindsay, a Havana-based journalist with news outlet Belly of the Beast, said Ferros news conference was ""a response to a lot of the international press coverage, a lot of whats going on on social media"" about the detained protesters. ""Some of the accusations against the government are that no lawyer has been provided to people who have gone to trial, that these have been summary trials - and the government did push back against that,"" Lindsay told Al Jazeera. ""The president of the Supreme Court said that they were not summary trials - that they were brief trials - but that they were sort of still in process,"" said Lindsay, who added that Ferro also notably said: ""Mistakes may have been made and they could be corrected in the judicial process."" ""It left open the possibility for some of these maybe more minor offences, for people to be released,"" Lindsay said. Hundreds of people were arrested during the demonstrations and many face charges of contempt, public disorder, vandalism and propagation of the coronavirus pandemic for allegedly marching without face masks. Independent observers and activists have published lists of those arrested - there are at least 600 names. The UNs human rights chief on July 16 called on Cuba to release protesters and several journalists who were also arrested. In a statement, Michelle Bachelet slammed the Cuban governments response, saying ""it is particularly worrying"" that those arrested included ""individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are unknown"". Ferro on Saturday said a faster trial system was being used to prosecute the accused but made assurances that due process was being followed.",['Christo Pher Rhodes'],7/24/2021 23:55,"Nearly 60 prosecuted over Cuba demonstrations, says top official","['charges', 'trial', 'nearly', 'lindsay', 'amid', 'protests', 'cuba', 'face', 'arrested', 'demonstrations', 'official', 'trials', 'prosecuted', 'told', 'process', '60']","Hundreds were arrested during protests this month and many face charges of contempt, public disorder and vandalism.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Saturday that Cuba is an ""example of resistance,"" and proposed the entire country should be declared a World Heritage site. While much of Cuba seems stuck technologically in the middle of the last century, Lopez Obrador did not appear to be speaking ironically when he proposed the world heritage designation, which is usually used by the United Nations to honor historical sites. The Mexican leader praised Cubas ability to stand up to U.S. hostility since 1959. Lopez Obrador did not mention recent street protests that were violently repressed by the Cuban government. Lopez Obrador has in the past stated his opposition to U.S. sanctions that limit commerce with the island, and said they should be ended. Lopez Obrador also said the Organization of American States should be replaced ""by a body that is truly autonomous, not anybodys lackey."" ADVERTISEMENT Mexico has publicly disagreed with the OAS leadership over its role in the political situation in countries like Bolivia. Lopez Obrador spoke Saturday at a ceremony attended by Cubas foreign minister to mark the 238th birthday of Simon Bolivar, who led the fight to liberate several South American countries from Spanish rule in the early 1800s. The Mexican government has said it is sending two navy ships to Cuba with food and medical aid on Sunday. The Foreign Relations Department said the ships will will carry oxygen tanks, needles and syringes, and basic food items like rice and beans. The announcement came on Thursday, the same day that the U.S. government tightened the sanctions on some Cuban officials after they violently put down rare street protests earlier this month. The new sanctions target a Cuban official and a government special brigade the United States says was involved in human rights abuses during the government crackdown.",[],7/25/2021 1:36,"Mexican president calls Cuba 'example,' wants OAS replaced","['sanctions', 'wants', 'president', 'replaced', 'obrador', 'lópez', 'cuban', 'ceremony', 'cuba', 'city', 'calls', 'manuel', 'mexican', 'example', 'oas']","Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks during a ceremony marking the third anniversary of his presidential election at the National Palace in Mexico City, Thursday, July 1, 2021.

A small flotilla of boats returned to Miami on Saturday evening after motoring off Cubas coast and setting off fireworks and flares in a show of support for the Cuban people and democracy. The boaters had left Miami on Friday morning. ""We also want to draw the attention to the United States government that they have to do something,"" organizer Jose Portieles told The Associated Press. ""We feel identified with what is happening in the protests in Cuba. We could be the ones who are there."" ""We also want to draw the attention to the United States government that they have to do something."" -- Jose Portieles, flotilla organizer Cuba considered the boats a provocation. Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodriguez called the flotilla illegal and urged the U.S. government to halt them ""to avoid incidents which are not in anyones best interest."" The U.S. Coast Guard warned the boaters it would be illegal for them to depart U.S. waters with the intention of entering Cuban territorial waters. However, for those intending only to go near Cuban waters, the agency merely advised against doing so. The boats reportedly stayed in international waters. BLOODIED LITTLE HAVANA DEMONSTRATOR SLAMS BIDEN: 'CUBANS DONT WANT VACCINES, THEY WANT FREEDOM Boater Marcos Suarez told WSVN-TV in Miami the experience gave him ""chills."" ""Theyre going to see us,"" organizer Osdany Veloz said while the boaters set off the fireworks. ""Theyre going to see us, and theyre going to see that were there for them."" ""Theyre going to see that were there for them."" -- Osdany Veloz, flotilla organizer Portieles said most of the boaters were Cuban-American entrepreneurs who know each other from the South Florida boating community and share a desire to see a free Cuba. The boaters also thanked the Coast Guard for helping make the trip possible, WSVN reported. Cubans historically took to the streets earlier this month in massive numbers to protest food shortages, high prices and other grievances against the government. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged government shortcomings in the lead-up to the unrest in the country after the protests broke out.

However, for those intending only to go near Cuban waters, the agency merely advised against doing so. -- Osdany Veloz, flotilla organizerPortieles said most of the boaters were Cuban-American entrepreneurs who know each other from the South Florida boating community and share a desire to see a free Cuba.",www.foxnews.com,Right,2614,"[-1.94623470e-04  1.66354626e-02 -3.01008821e-02  5.24095707e-02

275,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/25/cuban-leftists-begin-to-turn-their-fire-on-the-harmful-practices-of-the-state,"Luis Emilio Aybar is a voice from the left, which in Cuba means pretty far left. By any measure, he should be a stalwart defender of the islands communist regime. After widespread public protests that two weeks ago roiled the nation, the 34-year-old published an article in the magazine La Tizza, which bills itself as ""a space to think about socialism"". After the prerequisite denunciation of the US, he wrote: ""What happened on 11 July is also because we communists and revolutionaries do not fight with sufficient force and efficiency the harmful practices of the state. ""We defend unity in a way that actually harms it ... We uncritically follow our leaders instead of rectifying their path. We agree to be disciplined, when what we have to do is think and act with our own heads."" In authoritarian Cuba, that sounded a lot like heresy. Cuba has always split international opinion. Its detractors are perhaps best represented by the US senator Marco Rubio, who called the island ""the only country in the world where Cubans cant succeed"". In turn, its supporters brook little criticism. Helen Yaffe, an author and academic from Glasgow University, recently arrived on the island, swiftly joining a government rally called by the government. Afterwards she declared on Novara Media: ""No one should underestimate the resilience of the Cuban revolution."" Within Cuba, the regime has long demanded such support, calling detractors gusanos, or worms. Yet the sight of thousands of Cubans taking to the streets to complain about a lack of food, medicines and electricity seems to have caused cracks to appear. Silvio Rodriguez is Cubas best-known singer-songwriter, a 74-year-old international superstar widely recognised as living his socialist values. In non-pandemic times, he stages monthly free concerts in the poorer barrios of Havana. Last week, however, he met the dissident playwright Yunior Garcia, who had been arrested during the protests. They discussed the unrest and the governments heavy-handed response. Shortly afterwards, Rodriguez called for the release of all those who had not resorted to violence. ""There must be less prejudice,"" he said. ""[There must be] more desire to solve the mountain of pending economic and political issues."" Carlos Fernandez de Cossio has blamed the US trade embargo for the demonstrations. Photograph: Ramon Espinosa/AP Criticism such as this has put the government on the defensive. It says the island has been subject to a wave of disinformation from the US. Carlos Fernandez de Cossio is Cubas point-man on the US, and second only to the foreign minister in importance at the ministry of foreign affairs. He insisted that claims that protesters had ""disappeared"" into jails and interrogation centres were just not true. ""There are people who have been detained and there are people that have been arrested, those that have violated the law,"" he said, although he would not give numbers. Independent media claim up to 650 people were detained, although many have now been released. Asked what he thought had brought Cubans on to the streets, De Cossio replied: ""Well, it wasnt capitalism."" The protesters had cried ""libertad"", freedom, and ""patria y vida"", homeland and life, the title of an anti-government song. The shortages they face are the result of Cuba running out of foreign currency, a situation hastened by the pandemic devastating an economy reliant on tourism. De Cossio blamed the 60-year-old US trade embargo, tightened to strangulation by Donald Trump and kept in place by Joe Biden. He said there had actually been more conversations with Washington during Trumps presidency than Bidens. ""Theres no dialogue at this moment,"" he said. Yet in his essay for La Tizza, Aybar strayed surprisingly close to another analysis, summarised by the Financial Times when it called Cuba a last ""lonely outpost of Marxist central planning"". ""During 2020, half of the countrys investments were allocated to hotel construction at a time when there was a drastic decrease in international tourism and an acute shortage of investment in agriculture,"" he wrote. He said 11 July needed to be a watershed. ""A failure to pressure the government from the left means that the right will take the initiative"", meaning ""more market, more private property, less education and public health."" Only time will reveal whether internal reform will satisfy the population. Another increasingly robust critic from within, Cubas former ambassador to the EU, Carlos Alzugaray, believes it will have to. He has just published an article saying it is ""essential"" that the government ""not make the mistake of blaming only external factors"". He was watching the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics on television as he pointed out that, despite the efforts of critics in the US, regimes such as China, Vietnam and Cuba have proved durable, and ""very difficult to overthrow"". It is his view that Cuba should follow China and Vietnam towards ""a market economy with socialist orientation"". Before he could get into that - or the governments potential reaction to the criticism from within - the pride in Cubas sovereignty that has always been a far greater and more unifying force than communism on the island revealed itself. The 69 athletes Cuba has sent to the Olympics appeared in the famous parade. Alzugaray faltered, his voice suddenly breaking with emotion.",['Ruaridh Nicoll'],7/25/2021 8:15,Cuban leftists begin to turn their fire on the 'harmful practices of the state',"['practices', 'state', 'harmful', 'called', 'begin', 'left', 'cuban', 'turn', 'foreign', 'cuba', 'island', 'cossío', 'cubans', 'cubas', 'wrote', 'international', 'leftists']","Luis Emilio Aybar is a voice from the left, which in Cuba means pretty far left.

276,https://havanatimes.org/features/pandemic-advances-fast-in-cuba-new-highs/,"By Circles Robinson Every morning at 9:00 AM, the National Director of Epidemiology of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, Dr. Francisco Duran gives the latest report on the Covid-19 situation. HAVANA TIMES - Only two days ago we reported records of new Covid-19 positives for Cuba. Now those figures are a thing of the past. On Saturday the new high was 8,853 with 80 deaths in the country of 11.2 million persons. In comparison, Florida, also spiking with new cases, has a population of 21 million and recorded 10,452 new positives on Saturday with 39 deaths. As testing apparently increased in the eastern part of the island, Guantanamo is now the most hard-hit province per capita. In one day, the new positive cases shot up from 642 to 1,181. The far eastern province has a population of 511,000. A first-hand report to Havana Times indicates that the number of sick patients in Guantanamo is probably far greater than had been previously reported. No independent questioning of official data is allowed in Cuba. Matanzas with 712,000 inhabitants had 1,461 new positives on Saturday, the second most per capita, and Cienfuegos with 407,000 was third with 794 new Covid-19 positives. Havana had 1,481 in a population of 2,129,000. The Public Health Ministry has warned that the numbers will most likely get worse before they get better. The 80 deaths on Saturday were a new high from the previous 67. Cuba is also facing a critical food shortage situation. People must wait for hours on end in long crowded lines to try and purchase something to eat at the US dollar stores. Others without that currency must resort to the illicit market at even higher prices. Failed farm policies have meant agriculture production has been dropping for years and now the government doesnt have the funds for imports. It had been importing 60-80% of the food sold on the island in its monopoly retail market run mainly by Cimex, the giant military corporation. Private import/sales businesses are not allowed in the state-centered economy. Meanwhile, even the most basic medicines are absent from pharmacy shelves, not to mention the crisis for chronic illness patients. Many Covid-19 patients are also without the medicines they need, as confirmed by our source in Guantanamo. The government does not allow any private pharmacies to exist on the island. In both shortages, food and medicine, a popular saying sums up government policy. ""No pitchean ni dejan batear"" (They dont pitch or let any one else bat). A recent decision, after the massive July 11 protests, to allow vacationers to bring in extra food and medicines in their suitcases and not have them penalized or confiscated by Customs, will help some families but wont scratch the surface of a nationwide problem for the overall population. Also, the number of flights is severely limited due to the pandemic.",[],7/25/2021 16:51,"Pandemic Advances Fast in Cuba, New Highs","['guantanamo', 'advances', 'pandemic', 'food', 'medicines', 'positives', 'reported', 'report', 'cuba', 'fast', 'covid19', 'patients', 'highs', 'times', 'population']","HAVANA TIMES - Only two days ago we reported records of new Covid-19 positives for Cuba.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - Demonstrations from those showing their support for people suffering from the crisis in Cuba are entering their third week. A rally was held on Sunday in Miami Beach at the intersection of 73rd Street and Collins Avenue. The group, holding Cuban flags and homemade signs, was getting the attention of passing drivers and spreading the message of ""free Cuba."" Organizers of the protest called it a peaceful gathering. At the event were not only Cuban-Americans, but people from Israel, Colombia and a host of other nations. Some people would like to see the United States doing more to help Cuba while many say that the world needs to see how people on the island are being treated. ""They should be free in their own countries and I welcome the day where I could go to my country of birth and enjoy it while its free,"" Cristina Moinelo said. ""Very difficult."" Another protest was held Sunday in Miramar. The crowd there also came out with Cuban flags and appealed for a better day in the communist country. Ad Just days ago, President Joe Biden issued individual, targeted sanctions against the regime in Cuba. Protesters even hit Washington, D.C. over the weekend near the White House to urge the U.S. to do more, and some Cuban-American South Florida members of Congress are listening. ""We must support them to be free. We must,"" Marsha Schwartz said. ""Its our duty to do so."" ""Its the world that has to say, 'Enough, we dont condone this,"" Moinelo said.","['Terrell Forney', 'Saira Anwer']",7/25/2021 22:18,Protest organizers hold peaceful gathering in Miami Beach for those suffering in Cuba,"['peaceful', 'say', 'showing', 'protest', 'beach', 'held', 'support', 'gathering', 'hold', 'world', 'cuba', 'moinelo', 'organizers', 'free', 'miami', 'suffering']","Demonstrations from those showing their support for people suffering from the crisis in Cuba are entering their third week.

Protesters from across the U.S. converged in front of the White House Sunday night in an effort to get the Biden administration to take a firmer stance in its effort to support anti-government demonstrators in Cuba. The Biden administration has announced its support of the protesters and has also leveled sanctions. The Miami Herald reported that even the protesters had different expectations of what the word ""more"" actually meant. Some went as far as suggesting a military intervention. ""We went into Kuwait, Somalia and didnt ask for anyones permission,"" Maria Fundora, the head of a Texas-based group called Cuba Libre, told the paper. ""We went in and killed Usama Bin Laden and didnt ask anyone. Are you telling me someone from Cuba needs to do something as horrible as 9/11 to get the U.S. to do something?"" GET THE FOX NEWS APP One of the more realistic options seems to be the U.S.'s ability to work around internet blackouts in the country so residents can better inform the world about the realities on the island.",['Edmund Demarche'],7/26/2021 6:12,Protests break out in front of WH urging Biden to take firmer stance on Cuba,"['break', 'urging', 'didnt', 'wh', 'effort', 'biden', 'support', 'stance', 'fox', 'protests', 'cuba', 'ask', 'firmer', 'administration', 'protesters', 'went']","Protesters from across the U.S. converged in front of the White House Sunday night in an effort to get the Biden administration to take a firmer stance in its effort to support anti-government demonstrators in Cuba.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido MEXICO CITY, July 26 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday that he thinks U.S. President Joe Biden must make a decision about the embargo against Cuba amid the biggest unrest in the Caribbean nation in decades. Lopez Obrador said it was not enough for countries to vote to end the embargo via the United Nations General Assembly, but that it was time to make a real decision about it, given that ""almost all countries of the world"" are against it. ""It is not conceivable that in these times they want to punish an independent country with a blockade,"" Lopez Obrador said.

It is a respectful call, from no point of view of interference, but we must separate the political from the humanitarian."" Cuban families should also face fewer restrictions on receiving remittances from those who live in the United States or any other country, Lopez Obrador added. ""How can it be blocked if it's not even government money?"" Lopez Obrador said. Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually, representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism. The transfers have been slowed by policies brought in under U.S. former President Donald Trump that led Western Union to close Cuban operations. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by decades-old U.S. embargo. Lopez Obrador says the U.S. embargo is a cause of the protests, which erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Mexico is due to send food and medical supplies, including syringes, oxygen tanks and masks, to Cuba via cargo ships. read more Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Reporting by Diego Ore and Cassandra Garrison; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",[],7/26/2021 14:00,"Mexican president says Biden must ""make decision"" on Cuba embargo","['reuterscom', 'embargo', 'president', 'lopez', 'biden', 'decision', 'cuba', 'unlimited', 'union', 'mexican', 'united', 'obrador']","Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador delivers a speech on the third anniversary of his presidential election victory at National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico July 1, 2021.

Representatives Maria Elvira Salazar, Carlos A. Gimenez, and Mario Diaz-Balart and Sen. Rick Scott are among the lawmakers who joined the demonstration. They met at 12:30 p.m. at Lafayette Square, and marched in front of the White House, and the Embassy of Cuba. A few of the demonstrators who said they couldnt travel with the caravans to Washington met in front of Versailles Restaurant in Miamis Little Havana neighborhood while Rudy Giuliani was visiting. There was another small group of protesters at the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami, as well as protesters and public officials at an event in Pembroke Pines. ""Obviously I am disturbed,"" said Broward County Mayor Steve Geller. ""They are rallying for the ability to speak without fear of being beaten or tortured, and this is what is happening. They are rallying for simple things like food and adequate medical care, which they are not getting anymore."" Ad Watch Christian De La Rosas 11 p.m. report: Cuban-American protesters continued to demonstrate in solidarity with those suffering on the island just south of Florida's panhandle. Last week, President Joe Biden and his administration committed to finding a way to provide uncensored internet access to Cubans and to issue U.S. sanctions against individual violators of human rights in Cuba starting by Corps General Alvaro Lopez Miera, who lead the crackdown on the July 11 uprising. Meanwhile in Cuba, Henry Constantin, the director of La Hora de Cuba, an independently-owned magazine, said officers arrested on July 11 in the city of Camaguey. He described the experience as, ""tough, annoying,"" and ""terrible."" Cuban American activists in South Florida said they had set up ""Cuban Missing,"" an organic database of alleged protesters. Diplomats from the U.S. and 20 other nations, including Colombia and Brazil, condemned Cuban authorities arrest and prosecution of protesters. Cuban American activists in South said they had set up ""Cuban MIssing,"" an organic database of alleged protesters.

Biden, who returned to the White House from his home of Delaware around 4 p.m. Sunday, might have been able to hear the ruckus from his second-floor residence. ""Libertad! Libertad!"" a group of hundreds chanted after dark on Pennsylvania Avenue in a video tweeted by Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.). The Miami Herald reported that the White Houses outdoor lights -- red, white and blue to mark the Tokyo Olympics -- were shut off at midnight, but that the rally continued into early Monday. People rally in support of continued anti-government protests in Cuba on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House on July 25, 2021, in Washington, DC. Getty Images A protester dresses as the Statue of Liberty as others wear Cuban flags during a demonstration in front of the White House in Washington, DC, on July 25, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Many of the rally-goers drove to DC in caravans from Florida. Loud protests can be unnerving to occupants of the White House. For example, an initial night of anti-police brutality protests in May 2020 after the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota prompted President Donald Trump to inspect an underground bunker. White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Biden could hear the protest as he tried to sleep.

She returned to the White House around 8 a.m. Monday after a trip to Japan for the Olympics. Anti-Communist Cubans have rallied outside the White House consistently since the largest anti-government protests in a generation broke out this month. Biden on Thursday authorized sanctions against one Cuban official and a Cuban government agency to punish a crackdown on protesters. Critics have called on the commander-in-chief to do more amid the suppression of protests -- and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told The Post last week that Republicans are weighing legislation to force the presidents hand. Biden previously said the US is investigating whether its technically possible to override an internet blackout imposed by Communist authorities. The lack of internet access prevents distribution of information on protests.",['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],7/26/2021 18:05,Loud protest at White House aims to push Biden into taking action against Cuba,"['dc', 'rally', 'president', 'protest', 'white', 'taking', 'biden', 'push', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'outside', 'loud', 'getty', 'aims', 'action']",Cuban Americans held a large rally outside the White House overnight from Sunday into Monday in a noisy bid to rouse President Biden to action against the islands Communist leaders.

284,https://www.foxnews.com/us/washington-cuban-embassy-protests-biden,"A sea of pro-democracy supporters descended upon the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C., Monday afternoon to demand an end to the communist dictatorship that has isolated the island nation from the United States for most of the last 62 years. The crowd, draped in Cuban flags and holding signs calling for freedom and liberty, chanted at the gates of the embassy on 16th Street, just blocks from the White House. ""People are dying,"" one protester told Fox News. ""Multiple times, Cuba has helped this country so it's time to return the favor,"" he added. BLACK LIVES MATTER GLORIFIED CUBAN DICTATOR FIDEL CASTRO One man wearing a shirt that read, ""Youre wrong, Joe, Cuba wants freedom,"" told Fox News that he would tell Biden to remove the team advising him on Cuba. ""He needs to get all [of] his advisers...get them out of there, and come here and talk to these people. We really know whats going on"" the man said. ""The advisers hes got? Theyre supporting communists,"" he continued. The Washington rally came after weeks of unrest in Cuba against the communist government over food shortages, a faltering economy and a resurgence in coronavirus cases. ""It's painful for me because I have family back there ... they're hiding right now because they don't want to be taken,"" another protester told Fox News. President Biden, who recently called Cuba a ""failed state,"" has come under fire for not doing enough to push for change in the reclusive country. ""At least talk about what is happening. At least say the truth. Give a press conference and talk about it,"" one protester pleaded to Biden.

285,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/26/cuba-minor-house-arrest-watching-protests/,"The family of 17-year-old Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez confirmed this weekend that the Communist Party of Cuba had sentenced her to eight months in prison for ""public disorder"" despite her insistence that she was not an active participant in the July 11 protests. After an international outcry followed the news that Zequeira would serve an eight-month sentence in one of Cubas most notorious political prisons, Cuban police altered the sentence to eight months of house arrest. Zequeira would retain her criminal record, however, despite being a minor, having no criminal history, and no evidence suggesting she was protesting the communist regime. Thousands of Cubans nationwide organized spontaneous protests on Sunday, July 11, calling for an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. The protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, consisting of marches in major city plazas and down the roads of smaller towns and villages. The Castro regime responded to the protests with disproportional violence, firing live ammunition into crowds and beating suspected protesters in public. In the immediate aftermath of the protests, the regime shut down nationwide access to the internet and ordered door-to-door raids of homes in the cities that had the largest protest turnout. The little video and images that Cubans have managed to smuggle out of the country indicate that police have identified protesters and beaten them in their own homes - in some cases shooting them despite them not appearing to present any threat - and disappeared them into the legal system. Human rights activists have denounced the regime for the mass arrest and disappearance of hundreds of people. Evidence compiled by non-governmental organizations indicates that the Castro regime is using mass sentencing procedures to rapidly process and imprison protesters. Zequeiras mother told the independent outlet Cubanet that her teen daughter was among those processed in such a way, arrested and processed in a ""trial"" with 11 other women. In between July 11, when she was arrested, and July 13, mother Yoanis Hernandez Cuadra knew nothing of her daughters fate - she had disappeared on her way to get a haircut, her mother said, in her native Havana. On July 13, police officers told Hernandez that her daughter had been arrested and was currently in 100 y Aldabo, one of Cubas most notorious political prisons. Officers told Hernandez, the mother said, that her daughter ""was not involved in protests and could leave with just a fine."" On July 22, Zequeira was sentenced to eight months in prison on charges of ""public disorder."" ""She was just watching because she had never seen a protest before,"" Hernandez told Cubanet. The mother noted that, among the 12 women and girls sentenced simultaneously in a summary trial was another 17-year-old girl alongside her mother. All left convicted of similar ""counterrevolutionary"" charges. The BBC confirmed on Monday that, in the early hours of that day, police had returned Zequeira to her house and sentenced her to house arrest instead of prison time, a decision that appeared to occur in response to international condemnation of the sentencing of a minor in a trial alongside adults that took minimal evidence into consideration. Hernandez told the BBC that Zequeira had suffered ""psychological abuse"" at 100 y Aldabo. Her descriptions included acts of torture like sleep deprivation. The Spanish NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders published a detailed analysis of the way the Cuban Communist Party has begun legally processing July 11 protesters. The group has documented cases of as many as 30 people being tried in the same procedure. The state is systematically denying the imprisoned basic due process rights like access to an attorney or even knowing what crime they stand accused of until as recently as an hour before the trial. A prosecutorial system barely exists, meaning police decide what to accuse prisoners of without prosecutors compiling indictments or formally charging them. ""From the time in which police open an 'investigation to the trial, the majority of cases last between 48 and 96 hours,"" Cuban Prisoners Defenders revealed. The Cuban dissident group Cuba Decide has documented 742 people either known to have been arrested or simply disappeared since July 11 as of Monday. On the list are the names of several prominent longtime political dissidents, including at least two arrested during the ""Black Spring"" protests of 2003: Angel Moya and Jose Daniel Ferrer. Also still missing is a man identified as Ernesto Frank Sanchez Aguilar who is not known to have participated in the July 11 protests but executed a single act of dissidence the next weekend: interrupting a large ""act of revolutionary affirmation"" orchestrated by the regime by shouting ""freedom!"" in front of international media cameras. Cuban state security agents proceeded to publicly beat him and take him away; his whereabouts remain unknown. Al menos 742 personas han sido detenidas y/o desaparecidas 562 continuan detenidas y/o desaparecidas 180 han sido liberadas *Esta cifra es inferior al total real y debe ser complementada #SOSCuba pic.twitter.com/9Vre3CN8wX -- CUBADECIDE (@CUBADECIDE) July 26, 2021 Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez responded to pressure from the free world this weekend by claiming that police arrested no minors and that Cuba respects human rights. The Spain-based publication Diario de Cuba noted that Cubas own attorney general, Yamila Pena, had stated in a press conference prior to Rodriguezs remarks that police indeed had arrested minors and that their cases ""are being evaluated."" Rodriguez has blamed the United States in prior comments for single-handedly orchestrating the July 11 protests, a claim for which no evidence exists.

Several Republican lawmakers rallied alongside Cuban Americans and pro-Democracy protesters who marched in D.C. on Monday to encourage the Biden administration to support the Cuban people in their fight for freedom. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., were among those who participated in the Cuba Freedom Rally near the White House. In a video posted to his Twitter account, Scott can be heard telling the crowd in Spanish that they are not alone in this fight and that the liberty of Cubans is very important to Americans. ""We will prevail if we show up every day and make sure Biden shows up every day,"" Scott said. BIDEN MAY SEND MORE STAFF TO US EMBASSY IN HAVANA TO SUPPORT CUBAN PEOPLE: SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Also in attendance were Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla. The rally took place on the 68th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. Republican Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Monday sent a letter to Biden requesting a meeting to discuss the best ways to move forward and support the Cuban people against the ""oppressive regime in Havana."" ""This is a moment when the United States can change the course of human history for the better,"" McCarthys letter read. ""We must support our Cuban brothers and sisters as they seek to take control of their future and liberate themselves from the communist malignancy."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Protesters marched in D.C. on Monday to put pressure on the administration to take further action to support the Cubans fighting for freedom. Earlier this month the Cuban people carried out the most widespread protests the country has seen in decades over food and medicine shortages, as well as power outages. The protests turned violent as participants clashed with the police. As previously reported by Fox News, the administration asked the State Department to review staffing levels at the embassy as a means to facilitate diplomatic and civil engagement, while it also engages with the private sector to make the internet more widely available to the countrys residents. Late last week Biden announced new sanctions against elements of the Cuban regime and said it will continue to designate Cuban officials responsible for violent repression and human rights violations. President Miguel Diaz-Canel gathered supporters in the streets following the mass demonstrations and delivered a speech where he partly blamed the U.S. embargo for the unrest.",['Brittany De Lea'],7/26/2021 20:12,Republicans march with protesters for Cuban freedom as they pushed Biden for more support,"['republicans', 'violent', 'biden', 'support', 'pushed', 'cuban', 'rep', 'fox', 'regime', 'scott', 'freedom', 'rfla', 'administration', 'protesters']","Several Republican lawmakers rallied alongside Cuban Americans and pro-Democracy protesters who marched in D.C. on Monday to encourage the Biden administration to support the Cuban people in their fight for freedom.

287,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/26/florida-democrats-struggle-with-cuba-messaging-republicans-succeed/,"Florida Democrats have struggled to find the right messages for Cubans, now resorting to President Joe Bidens Cuba stance as Florida Republicans excel by showing the urgency and importance of the protests. Since the beginning of the demonstrations in Cuba and across the United States, Floridians such as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R) held a live town hall in Miami, with Fox Newss Sean Hannity last Wednesday, showing their strong approach to support Cubans. But, Florida Democrats are looking to stand behind the president. The Florida House Republicans have been running online public service announcements that show why it is important to support the Cuban people while also hitting Cubas leaders for the lack of essentials while adding that the Biden administration needs to ""listen to the Cuban community."" Part of the onslaught of announcements from the Florida House Majority Twitter, one read, ""I challenge the Biden administration to listen to the Cuban community that want the same freedom we too often take for granted"" from state House Rep. Alex Andrade (R). Another one from state House Rep. Juan Fernandez-Barquin (R) said, ""For decades the Cuban people have lived in darkness. Now they have an opportunity to come into the light of democracy. We must help them."" However, Democrats launched an online ad campaign over the weekend meant to highlight Bidens response to Cuba. The ad campaign will cost them ""five figures"" to reach ""nearly one million Floridians in the Tampa Bay, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach County regions,"" according to a spokesperson from the Democratic National Committee. The Democrats ads come as the party struggles to find a message on Cuba. As the Maimi Herald reported, some far-left members of the party ""called for an end to the American embargo against the island nation, arguing it has worsened conditions for Cubans while doing little to chip away at the governments power."" There are more Democrats who are backing Bidens stance with ""doubling down on economic penalties against the regime."" The Herald reported on the ads that will be running on social media platforms, saying:",['Jacob Bliss'],7/26/2021 21:34,"Florida Democrats Struggle with Cuba Messaging, Republicans Succeed","['succeed', 'state', 'republicans', 'florida', 'support', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'house', 'cubans', 'democrats', 'r', 'bidens', 'struggle', 'messaging']","Florida Democrats have struggled to find the right messages for Cubans, now resorting to President Joe Bidens Cuba stance as Florida Republicans excel by showing the urgency and importance of the protests.

""After years of torment, arbitrary imprisonments, brutality, corruption, and human rights abuses, the Cuban people have taken to the streets in protest,"" the group wrote. In their letter, the Republicans described the ""largest protests in years"" that are happening in Cuba and across the United States. They noted that because of this, ""the communist regime decided to block access to the Internet, brutally suppress the protests by attacking and jailing protestors, and refuse to acknowledge the Cuban peoples desires for a better life and freedom."" However, despite all of this, they wrote, ""Cuban people and their allies in Congress refuse to be deterred."" ""This is a moment when the United States can change the course of human history for the better,"" the group of Republicans explained. ""The United States is a bastion of freedom and democracy; a beacon across the globe for those seeking to toss away their shackles of communist oppression."" ""We must support our Cuban brothers and sisters as they seek to take control of their future and liberate themselves from the communist malignancy,"" they added. Due to all of this, the group is requesting a meeting with Biden, saying they would like ""to discuss how Congress and your Administration can work together to bring an end to the oppressive communist regime in Havana and liberate the Cuban people."" ""Now is the time to act,"" they finished. McCarthy said in a tweet: I just requested a meeting with the White House to discuss how to best support the Cuban people in their quest for liberty against the oppressive regime in Havana. The world is watching--this is a moment when the U.S. can change the course of human history for the better.

They have falsely claimed the protests are about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido MEXICO CITY, July 27 (Reuters) - Mexico's president on Tuesday asserted his country's right to send fuel to Cuba and said U.S. sanctions on the island were ""inhumane,"" after a diesel cargo shipped by Mexico's state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos arrived in Cuba's Havana port. Mexico's left-leaning President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has criticized the U.S. embargo against Cuba and pledged support for the Communist-run island, which has been hit by a surge in coronavirus infections and an economic slump that triggered rare protests this month. A shipment of humanitarian aid departed from the Mexican port of Veracruz on Tuesday destined for Cuba, and another is scheduled to set sail on Wednesday, carrying food, oxygen tanks and other medical supplies, Mexico's foreign ministry said in a release. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""We are an independent nation,"" Lopez Obrador said at a news conference in response to a question about whether deliveries risked contravening the U.S. embargo on the Communist-run island. Lopez Obrador criticized policies he said made it difficult for ships that delivered goods to Cuba to then dock in U.S. ports, which constitutes one of the main aspects of the embargo. Mexico's foreign ministry said the aid is part of a cooperation agreement between Mexico and Cuba. Authorities in Havana have long said the decades-old U.S. embargo on Cuba has caused widespread hardship on the island, where thousands took to the streets this month in the protests. Cuban Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca welcomed on Monday Mexico's pledge of two shipments of aid: ""We are not alone,"" he said on Twitter. The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment and the State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment. John S. Kavulich, president of New-York based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said there were no specific U.S. sanctions preventing the sale - or donation - of Mexican fuel to Cuba. ""The U.S. embargo on Cuba is not focused on Cuba's imports but on U.S exports to Cuba,"" Kavulich said, adding that the Caribbean island did not appear to be a foreign policy priority for U.S. President Joe Biden. Lopez Obrador, who on Monday called on Biden to ""make a decision"" about the ""inhumane"" embargo on Cuba, last week had anticipated that Mexico would send fuel to generate electricity for the island's hospitals. The Jose Maria Morelos II, a tanker owned and managed by a Pemex unit, departed last week from the Mexican port of Coatzacoalcos bound for the Caribbean, according to Refinitiv Eikon tanker monitoring data. The vessel, which is carrying some 100,000 barrels of diesel according to the foreign ministry's release, has not updated its port of destination, but it docked at the Havana port late on Monday, the Eikon data showed. read more It is yet unclear which Cuban entity will receive the fuel. Cuba's dependence on diesel has increased in recent years as power plants using fuel oil and crude have been in urgent need of investment and maintenance. The island is also struggling to supply power plants with natural gas, said Jorge Pinon from the University of Texas at Austin. An oil-for-services arrangement between Venezuela and Cuba ran afoul of U.S. sanctions on the South American oil producer when in 2019 the U.S. Department of Treasury blacklisted a group of tanker owners and vessels involved in the shipments, at the Venezuelan opposition's request. Cuba's economy has been damaged by Venezuela's collapse, along with a slump in tourism following the global coronavirus pandemic.

Leticia, an activist at Mondays rally, described the Communist Partys orders for civilians to attack suspected protesters as a ""genocide"" given that the Cuban people have no right to bear arms and no way of defending themselves against state-sponsored violence. The assembly in Washington on Monday attracted thousands of people, potentially the largest ever of its kind in opposition to the Cuban Revolution in the United States. Protesters peacefully marched to the White House, urging Biden to take stronger actions to weaken the Castro regimes ability to attack its own people. Los cubanos tomaron la capital de EUA . Esta debe ser una de las protestas mas grandes de cubanos en Washington DC. El himno que los acompana es #PatriaYVida. pic.twitter.com/u0PZIeE3oH -- Norges Rodriguez (@norges14) July 26, 2021 Cuba experienced a nationwide wave of protests on July 11, attracting thousands to peacefully march in dozens of cities from one end of the island to the other. While the protests - calling for an end to 62 years of communist dictatorship - were overwhelmingly peaceful and reports indicate those involved were civilians with little or no history of dissident activity, the Castro regime responded by deploying state security agents to shoot at, publicly beat, and disappear people suspected of participating in the protests. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the current face of the Castro regime, issued an ""order of combat"" in a televised speech that day ordering civilians to take the streets and violently assault anyone suspected of disagreeing with the communist ""Revolution."" ""We are calling all the revolutionaries of our country, all the communists, to go to the streets anywhere that these provocations are happening today, from now on through all these days,"" Diaz-Canel urged. ""The moment that Diaz-Canel in Cuba gave the order of combat to the people in Cuba that have no means of defending themselves, thats not even a civil war, thats genocide right there,"" Leticia, the protester in Washington, told Breitbart News. ""And Bidens silence is only saying that he is agreeing with that because when you stay in silence in front of a genocide, that only means that youre an ally or that you have something to gain from this."" Leticia recalled that Biden supported the Black Lives Matter movement. ""When it was all about Black Lives Matter, he really stepped up on that, so what about Cubans lives? It doesnt matter? What about these childrens lives, it doesnt matter? Where is the UNICEF, the organization for the children? Where is the United Nations?"" ""So that is our issue with Biden, that that administration has done nothing - not even emotional support for the people dying right now,"" the protester noted. ""Moms in Cuba are committing suicide right now because their children are literally bleeding to death and the mom had to commit suicide - not only one, some of them. ... None of this, theyre not even showing it on the news."" Leticia appeared to be referring to the case of the mother of Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, the only person the Communist Party has confirmed to have died in the protests. Tejeda, 36, was reportedly participating in protests when police opened fire on an unarmed crowd in Havana and died of gunshot wounds. Reports from Cuba following the confirmation of his death indicated that his mother, who has not been named, overdosed on unspecified medication deliberately following the death of her only son. Cuban human rights organizations have identified at least 742 people who are either confirmed in police custody or have disappeared since July 11, a significantly lower number than the estimated thousands actually imprisoned both on that day and during subsequent protests. Many of those on the confirmed list are well-known dissidents, which makes it easier to find someone to reach out to who can confirm their status. At the top of the list is the head of what is believed to be Cubas largest dissident organization, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), Jose Daniel Ferrer. Ferrers whereabouts remain unknown as of Tuesday and his family does not know what, if anything, police have charged him with. The mothers of the missing attempted to organize a protest last week demanding to know the status of their children. The Castro regime cut off access to the internet in the immediate aftermath of the protests, however, and deployed a massive state security presence around the homes of protest organizers to prevent them from leaving their homes. Videos surfacing from Havana show police abruptly plucking people off of the street who were suspected of attempting to reach an assembly point to support the group of mothers. The Biden administration has done little in response to the protests. Administration officials first dismissed the protests as a call for help fighting the Chinese coronavirus, not a demand for regime change. Biden himself later issued a tepid statement in support of the ""Cuban people"" and organized Zoom meetings with prominent Cuban-American celebrities Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia. Last week, Biden sanctioned on Cuban administration official, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the ""black beret"" Cuban special repression forces - both of whom Washington had already sanctioned under predecessor Donald Trump.

291,https://www.foxnews.com/world/republicans-join-cubans-capitol-protest,"Republican lawmakers joined protesters outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday to hold a press conference in support of freeing Cuba from its communist regime. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News the group was there to speak out for the Cuban people who have been protesting against the Cuban government. ""The incredible heroes and patriots that are taking to the street, risking their lives to speak out against the communist dictatorship,"" he said. The Cuban protesters are speaking out ""against the oppression, poverty, misery, murder, the torture that has been carried out for decades from the tyrannical Cuban government,"" Cruz explained. PROTESTERS DESCEND ON CUBAN EMBASSY, ACCUSE BIDEN TEAM OF SUPPORTING COMMUNISM Many protesters at the event said they were there to demand the Biden administration do more. One Cuban protester told Fox News that Biden needs to implement ""strict measures, something that shakes the government."" ""It has to be strong enough to send a strong message over there. The government cannot go and violate those young people's rights, oppressing them,"" she added ""Show some of that Joe Biden-patented empathy for the people of Cuba. They're looking for it, you can give it,"" another protester told Fox News. Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., said, ""Biden has said some words about supporting the people of Cuba and I agree with that, but we need some actions."" ""Biden needs to pressure other countries to do what we need to do, and boycott the regime. The regime takes the business, trade and the money and they use it to oppress the people,"" Mooney explained. One group that traveled from Florida said they're asking the administration to help free the people. ""No vaccines, sending money, or food or things like that, what we need is freedom,"" the group told Fox News. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""People are dying.

""No vaccines, sending money, or food or things like that, what we need is freedom,"" the group told Fox News. Cruz told Fox News he believes Cuba will see freedom.",www.foxnews.com,Right,2147,"[-2.74554156e-02 -9.47111286e-03 -2.40818318e-02  6.85159788e-02

292,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-health-cuba-caribbean-ef152e53bb21cb483079875f75ecdb7f,"Children play on a street that has graffiti reading is Spanish ""Put your heart on Cuba,"" in Havana, Cuba, Monday, July 26, 2021 (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) Children play on a street that has graffiti reading is Spanish ""Put your heart on Cuba,"" in Havana, Cuba, Monday, July 26, 2021 (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two Mexican ships carrying food, fuel and medical supplies were sailing to Cuba on Tuesday and a third was getting ready to head there Wednesday, in what experts said was Mexicos biggest aid run for Cuba in almost three decades. The first ship left late Monday loaded with 100,000 barrels of diesel fuel that the Mexican government said would be used to provide power for Cuban hospitals. A second ship operated by the Mexican navy left Tuesday, and the third ship will leave Wednesday. The Foreign Relations Department said those two ships are carrying oxygen tanks, needles and syringes as well as basic food items like powdered milk, cooking oil and beans. The department described the shipments as ""humanitarian assistance"" to help Cuba weather the coronavirus pandemic. Rafael Elias Rojas, a Cuban historian and professor at the College of Mexico, said that ""this is a new phenomenon,"" comparable only to Cubas ""special period"" in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union cut off the islands economic subsidies. ADVERTISEMENT ""There have been minor instances of aid during hurricane seasons, but the last big aid efforts of this scale or larger, were during the administration of (former Mexican president) Carlos Salinas de Gortari, when exchanges with Cuba increased significantly and when, as now, there was a deep economic crisis on the island,"" Rojas said. Carlos Salinas de Gortari governed from 1988 to 1994. And until Mexicos democratic transition in 2000, Mexicos old ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party had a longstanding policy of opposing U.S. interference in Cuba, in part because Mexico feared outside criticism of its own less-than-democratic regime. Lorena Ruano, a professor at Mexicos Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said Mexicos policy was ""to defend the sovereignty of other countries, so that 'others wont criticize me."" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is a fervent believer in that old policy, and last week he called Cuba an ""example of resistance"" and proposed that the entire country be declared a World Heritage site. While much of Cuba seems stuck technologically in the middle of the last century, Lopez Obrador did not appear to be speaking ironically when he proposed the world heritage designation, which is usually used by the United Nations to honor historical sites. Lopez Obrador praised Cubas ability to stand up to U.S. hostility since 1959, but did not mention recent street protests that were violently repressed by the Cuban government. Lopez Obrador has in the past stated his opposition to U.S. sanctions that limit commerce with the island, and said they should be ended. On Thursday, the U.S. government tightened the sanctions on some Cuban officials over the suppression of the rare street protests earlier this month. The new sanctions target a Cuban official and a government special brigade that the United States says was involved in human rights abuses during the government crackdown.",['Maria Verza'],7/27/2021 20:18,"3 Mexican ships taking fuel, medical aid and food to Cuba","['sanctions', 'food', 'obrador', 'policy', 'taking', 'aid', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'street', 'ship', 'economic', 'mexicos', 'mexican', 'fuel', 'medical', 'ships']","The first ship left late Monday loaded with 100,000 barrels of diesel fuel that the Mexican government said would be used to provide power for Cuban hospitals.

293,https://nypost.com/2021/07/27/gop-seeks-meeting-with-biden-on-responding-to-cuba-crackdown/,"A group of Congressional Republicans wrote to President Biden seeking a meeting to discuss how the US can better respond to the anti-government protests in Cuba, according to a report. The 19 lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, requested the sitdown to determine how the administration and Congress ""can work together to bring an end to the oppressive communist regime in Havana and liberate the Cuban people."" ""Now is the time to act,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter  sent Monday and obtained by The Hill.  Hundreds of Cubans took to the streets earlier this month to protest food shortages and rising prices amid the  coronavirus pandemic, with many chanting ""Freedom,"" Enough,"" and ""Unite.""  On Monday evening, a crowd of Cuban-Americans staged a rally outside the White House  to encourage the administration to back the protests in the Caribbean nation. The GOP lawmakers said after decades of communist rule, ""this is a moment when the United States can change the course of human history for the better."" ""The United States is a bastion of freedom and democracy; a beacon across the globe for those seeking to cast off the shackles of communist oppression; a beacon across the globe for those seeking to cast off the shackles of communist repression,"" they wrote.

AFP via Getty Images ""We must support our Cuban brothers and sisters as they seek to take control of their future and liberate themselves from the communist malignancy,"" they added.  But the Republicans said ""this pivotal moment is being squandered by indecision, bureaucracy, and a failure to lead . "" The administration last week sanctioned a Cuban official and a government agency over the protest crackdown.  ""My Administration is imposing new sanctions targeting elements of the Cuban regime responsible for this crackdown -- the head of the Cuban military and the division of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior driving the crackdown -- to hold them accountable for their actions ,"" the White House said in a statement  last Thursday. The US also signed on to a statement with 20 other countries on Monday, condemning Cuba for arresting protesters.   "" The Cuban government has responded not by recognizing the voices of its own people, but by further stifling those voices through arbitrary detentions and secret summary trials lacking due process guarantees ,"" the statement said.   "" The United States will continue to support the Cuban peoples desire for freedom and to determine their own future. This joint statement demonstrates that the Cuban people are not alone in their aspirations ,"" it said.   Others signing on include: Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Guatemala, Greece, Honduras, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Korea, and Ukraine.",['Social Links For Mark Moore'],7/27/2021 21:44,Republicans seek meeting with Biden on better response to Cuba crackdown,"['states', 'meeting', 'republicans', 'united', 'biden', 'communist', 'cuban', 'lawmakers', 'cuba', 'house', 'freedom', 'seeking', 'better', 'crackdown', 'response', 'administration', 'statement', 'seek']","A group of Congressional Republicans wrote to President Biden seeking a meeting to discuss how the US can better respond to the anti-government protests in Cuba, according to a report.

294,https://nypost.com/2021/07/27/five-high-ranking-cuban-generals-dead-in-10-days/,"Five high-ranking military leaders died in the span of just 10 days, according to the Cuban government -- though its remained mum on the causes. Brig. Gen. Armando Choy Rodriguez, 87, was the latest aging revolutionary to die, with Marta Abreu Central University announcing on Twitter that he passed away Monday. Rodriguez was the founder of the ""July 26 Movement"" in Las Villas, and an author and historian, WPLG-TV in Miami said. Also on Monday, Manuel Eduardo Lastres Pacheco, a former general who served under Argentine Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara during the revolution in the late 1950s, passed away, Cuban television confirmed. Pacheco later served as commander of Cubas eastern army. On Saturday, Gen. Ruben Martinez Puente, a 79-year-old general in Cubas army reserve and a controversial figure in the military, also died. Puente was the general who gave the order to shoot down a civilian plane from the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue in 1996 -- bringing tensions with the US to a fever pitch. Marcelo Verdecia Perdomo, another army reserve brigadier general and a former Castro bodyguard, died on July 20, the Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Finally, Agustin Pena Porres, former commander of the western army and a member of Cubas Communist Central Committee, passed away on July 17, WPLG said. Manuel Eduardo Lastres Pacheco, who served under Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara in the 1950s, was one of the generals who passed away. AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa According to Florida-based news outlet Periodico Cubano, the deaths follow that of Brig. Gen. Ivan Duponte Cabrales in May at the age of 77. The more recent deaths come in the wake of massive protests in the Communist country earlier this month, with thousands of Cubans taking to the streets to demand freedom, food, and medications -- including COVID vaccines. The global pandemic has spiked in the past month, with new daily cases jumping from 1,880 on June 24 to 7,732 one month later. Overall, Cuba has had more than 340,000 coronavirus cases and 2,417 deaths since the outbreak of the deadly virus last year, WPLG said. Cuban government officials have not said if the recent deaths of the five military leaders were linked to the virus. -",['Social Links For Jorge Fitz-Gibbon'],7/27/2021 22:30,Five high-ranking Cuban generals dead in 10 days,"['highranking', 'generals', 'deaths', 'passed', 'served', 'military', 'cuban', 'gen', 'away', 'month', 'general', 'cubas', 'days', 'dead']","Five high-ranking military leaders died in the span of just 10 days, according to the Cuban government -- though its remained mum on the causes.

295,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/28/cuba-minor-arrested-witnessing-protests-says-police-threatened-rape-her/,"A 17-year-old girl sentenced to eight months of house arrest for having witnessed protests in Cuba on July 11 told the independent outlet Cubanet in an interview this week that police forced her to strip naked and threatened to subject her to rape by two large men. Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez was on her way back home from the hairdresser in her native Havana when she noticed what she described as the largest crowd of people she had ever seen in her life. On July 11, Cubans nationwide took to the streets of nearly every major city in the country demanding an end to the communist regime. The protests reportedly attracted thousands of people, the vast majority marching peacefully through main streets and into central plazas calling for the communist regime to step down, and represented the largest nationwide simultaneous protest in recent memory. Police arrested Zequeira and branded her a ""counterrevolutionary"" for being near the vicinity of protests. Zequeira -- and her mother, who insisted for days during her daughters arrest that the girl did not intend to participate -- said she attempted to explain to police repeatedly that she did not even know what the assembly she was viewing was for. She also repeatedly told police she was underaged, she asserted, but was told she was only technically underage ""for some things,"" without elaborating. Zequeiras mother did not know of her whereabouts between Sunday, July 11, and that Tuesday. Police initially sentenced Zequeira to eight months in prison for ""public disorder"" but reduced the sentence to house arrest following international condemnation for the violation of human rights that her case represents. Zequeira recounted her experience to Cubanet, pausing on some occasions to express shame at describing the comments police made to her and crying when remembering the first moment she saw her mother again after being arrested. ""When I was on the way back from the hairdresser home ... I got so surprised; Im 17 and Id never seen a protest so big, such a big crowd of people ... the officials got me,"" Zequeira explained. ""They assaulted me, they grabbed my arm, manhandling me; they stuffed me in the police car like I was anything. I asked them in the car, 'Why am I here? Im 17.'"" ""They told me, 'This is so you know you cant be protesting against YOUR revolution. You are a counterrevolutionary,'"" she recalled. Once sent to a jail cell, an official told her, the girl relayed, that her mother was at the station. At the time, Zequeira noted, police had not notified her mother of the arrest and she was not present at the police station. ""A woman officer told me, 'Your mother is waiting for you here -- which my mother didnt even know -- your mother is waiting for you here, which I cried from how impotent I felt -- 'Your mother is waiting for you here with a stick to beat you for being such a counterrevolutionary.'"" Police told her the next morning to pack her things and prepare to go home, as she was being released. This, too, Zequeria said, was a lie: police instead bussed her to 100 y Aldabo, one of Havanas most notorious prisons. The facility has for decades had a reputation of being a central hub of torture and abuse of anti-communist dissidents. ""They took me to the dressing room and told me 'take your clothes off, take your shirt off,'"" Zequeira explained. ""They searched my bra looking for wires. I dont know why they had to do that. I kept telling them I was a minor ... and they didnt listen."" ""Then they told me 'take off your shorts and your panties,'"" she continued. ""I took off my shorts and underwear, and there they told me to cough, to squat and squeeze the lower part of my torso. They told me to stick my finger inside me to see if I was carrying anything. I told them I was a minor; they couldnt do that."" ""They told me, 'youre a minor for some things, but not others. Right now, you are of age,'"" Zequeria said. The teen girl added that, while in her prison cell, officials came into her cell and threatened to have two men rape her. She noted that they told her they would send her ""to the pavilion,"" which she assumed meant they would beat and torture her, but relatives explained when she recounted the story at home that the prison slang term actually refers to ""sexual relations."" ""One of the most unpleasant moments I had ... they came into my cell and said they were going to get a guy named 'Hose and a guy named 'Sledgehammer and take me out to the 'pavilion,'"" Zequeira told Cubanet, expressing clear embarrassment while retelling the story. ""That 'Hose was a mulatto guy, strong, with a not that big ... thing but more or less. And Sledgehammer was a black man, strong, very big, who did have it big. He told me laughing."" ""They just explained to me now that I got out that 'pavilion is to go have sexual relations,"" she said. Zequeira emphasized that, while she did not initially intend to protest, she now supported the movement against the regime. ""I want to send a message to all these minors, all these women, the mothers, too, like mine: keep struggling ... the mothers, keep struggling so that they free all these women that have nothing to do with this,"" she said. ""Its an injustice -- even if you had done it [protested] -- it feels like in the entire world there is freedom of expression and everything you say is respected. Here, it is not respected."" At press time, international human rights groups have documented at least 740 people nationwide missing or in police custody for protesting since July 11. Experts on human rights in Cuba caution that the number is likely significantly smaller than the true toll and that thousands may be missing or imprisoned, many unreachable from abroad because of the large number of protests against the regime in the remote interior of the country. Among them, international groups have confirmed at least a dozen cases of imprisoned minors. Foreign Ministry Bruno Rodriguez initially denied that police had arrested any children during the protests last week, but his remarks occurred after Attorney General Yamila Pena had already told reporters, ""there have been some minors; it is under investigation.""

296,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/cuba-generals-deaths-covid-19-coronavirus,"Five mostly elderly and retired Cuban military generals have died in recent days in mysterious circumstances, the countrys communist regime has confirmed, adding intrigue to a new round of freedom protests taking place in the island and US. There is no suggestion of foul play in the deaths of the five, one of whom was the former head of Cubas air force when it shot down two American private planes in the infamous 1996 Brothers to the Rescue outrage. But with Covid-19 surging across the island, and the average number of daily new cases in Cuba close to 8,000, almost eight times higher than the beginning of July, observers fear that the pandemic could be responsible. The youngest of the generals was 57. Cubas government has not given an explanation or cause of death for any of the five. According to the Miami Herald, which first reported the story, the deaths came within days of anti-government protests across Cuba, the largest show of public dissent against the regime in decades. The demise of the generals also caught the attention of Floridas senior senator Marco Rubio, whose parents immigrated from Cuba in the 1950s, before Fidel Castros 1959 communist revolution. ""Nine days. Five dead generals in #Cuba. Very strange,"" he tweeted on Tuesday, following up an earlier tweet in which he noted that high-ranking military officials ""have had some incredibly bad luck recently"". Rubio has been one of the most vocal politicians against the Cuban government in Florida, home to more than 1.5m exiles and first and second-generation Cuban-Americans, and has joined recent protests in Miamis Little Havana neighborhood. The best-known of the five is Ruben Martinez Puente, 79, a former chief of the Cuban air force who was indicted in Miami in 2003 but never faced trial for the incident seven years earlier in which two pilots and two other passengers were killed when a Cuban military jet shot down their Cessna planes in international waters. Martinez Puente died on 24 July, the Herald reported, citing a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba memorandum. The others, the newspaper said, included Agustin Pena Porrez, a former head of Cubas eastern army, who died on 17 July at the age of 57. It said the communist party newspaper Granma published pictures of his funeral and quoted a tweet by Cuban leader Miguel Diaz-Canel saying the death was ""sad news."" Marcelo Verdecia, a retired brigadier general and former Castro bodyguard, died 20 July in Santa Clara. Retired brigadier general Eduardo Lastres Pacheco died on Monday this week, and on Tuesday the Twitter account of the university of Las Villas reported the death of retired brigadier general Armando Choy Rodriguez, 87. No ages were given for Verdecia or Lastres Pacheco.",['Richard Luscombe'],7/28/2021 19:25,Five Cuban generals dead in recent days - is the Covid spike to blame?,"['generals', 'died', 'military', 'recent', 'cuban', 'protests', 'covid', 'cuba', 'blame', 'retired', 'general', 'death', 'reported', 'days', 'dead', 'spike']","Five mostly elderly and retired Cuban military generals have died in recent days in mysterious circumstances, the countrys communist regime has confirmed, adding intrigue to a new round of freedom protests taking place in the island and US.

297,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/28/demonstrators-lawmakers-demand-internet-for-cuba-biden-asleep-and-clueless/,"Protesters gathering in support of human rights in Cuba in Washington, DC, lamented that President Joe Biden has taken little to no action after thousands-strong protests rocked the communist nation on July 11. Cuban-Americans, joined by human rights activists and members of Congress, gathered at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday and called on the Biden Administration to act in the face of brutal communist repression following the July 11 protests. Activists and Republican lawmakers spoke at the protest, expressing solidarity and laying out goals they hope to see the president fulfill, including restoring internet access to the island. The Castro regime has blocked access to the internet since videos of peaceful protests - and violent attacks on protesters - began circulating this month. ""Whats the very first thing that brutal dictators around the world do as soon as people start to see whats taking place inside their regimes? They shut down connectivity. They block access to the internet because the thing that they hate the most is the spotlight of the world seeing what they are doing,"" said Brendan Carr, senior Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Rep. Maria Salazar (R-FL), a Cuban-American who represented a heavily Cuban-American district in Florida, claimed that protests in Cuba began because of a post on social media. ""Why is [restoring internet] so important? Because of everything on July 11 started because someone in a remote town in Cuba was doing a Facebook live, and then the rest of the island saw it -- and then it spread like wildfire,"" Salazar said. Watch: Exclusive Interview with Rep. Salazar: ""This Is the Beginning of the End"" for Cubas Communist Regime Biden has been under mounting pressure from human rights groups to assist protesters against Cubas violent regime. Since protests began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten protesters in the streets. In the immediate aftermath of the protests, the regime shut down nationwide access to the internet and ordered door-to-door raids of homes in the cities that had the largest protest turnout. The White House has discussed providing internet to Cuba but, two weeks later, Biden has not yet approved a plan. ""We have the technological capability to support internet connectivity for the people of Cuba. We can stand with them. We can beam in new internet services from off-island,"" Carr said. ""We can support circumvention tools that allow the people of Cuba to get around the blocking and the filtering of the internet and connections that exist right there."" ""Weve done this before around the globe. This is not a technological challenge. This is a political challenge,"" Carr continued. ""Will the Biden Administration stand for freedom? ... Its been two weeks and I hope we get there."" When speaking to the crowd, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said, ""time is of the essence"" and said he does not ""understand what it takes to make Biden move."" Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R) agreed when he spoke, asking ""where is this guy?"" in reference to Biden. Watch: Sen. Rick Scott: Biden Needs to Get Rid of ""Illegitimate"" Cuban Embassy in D.C. ""Call it socialism, call it communism -- it will fall because of the heroism of the Cuban people. It will fall because the American people understand freedom. It will fall, despite a president that is totally asleep and clueless,"" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) joined in. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki initially attempted to claim that protesters in Cuba were objecting to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, not 62 years of violent communism, before finally condemning communism as a ""failed ideology"" several days later. Biden, too, took several days to explicitly condemn communism and failed to mention public beatings and other brutalities perpetrated by the Cuban regime. He has since sanctioned only one Cuban official - already under sanctions thanks to the administration of President Donald Trump and with no known U.S. assets - and held a Zoom call with Cuban-American celebrities to gather ""advice"" on potential policy changes. ""My question for president Biden is, are you with the dictators of Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, China -- or are you with the American people who want freedom and the Cuban people who dying for freedom, literally as we speak,"" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) said. Watch: GOP Rep., Daughter of Cuban Refugee Asks Biden: Are You with Dictators? Marta Ferrer, the daughter of Cuban human rights activist Jose Daniel Ferrer, also spoke at the event, telling the crowd in Spanish that, as of Tuesday, her father has been missing for 17 days. The elder Ferrer is the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), the countrys largest dissident organization. He most recently disappeared in October 2019 after organizing nationwide protests corresponding to the feast day of Cubas patron saint, Our Lady of Charity, only to resurface with clear signs of torture six months later. The younger Ferrer said of the protesters: [My dad] and hundreds of Cubans who went out to demand freedom for Cuba and an end to the tyranny in Cuba. Today, we dont know anything of him or the other hundreds of Cubans. We dont know if they are torturing them, which is the likeliest thing. We dont know if he is alive because they dont give him a phone call, no visits, they dont give us any proof of him and all the families in Cuba who now have missing relatives today ... Today I am here supporting you all and expressing solidarity with all the families and demanding that the dictatorship give proof of life for all the disappeared, of my father, that the repression end in Cuba, that they stop killing innocents, imprisoning innocents going out on the street to demand an end to the tyranny and demand the freedom that 62 years ago, the dictatorship stole from them.

298,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/28/rep-maria-salazar-beginning-end-cuba-communist-regime/,"Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL) told Breitbart News in an interview Wednesday that she believes protests beginning on July 11 in Cuba are ""the beginning of the end"" for communism there. ""There is no turning back. After 62 years of a repressive apparatus that has been extremely effective, people lose everything: their homes, their families, their health, their education, because Cuba is a completely failed state,"" Salazar said. ""But now they have lost fear, which is the last thing that you lose in a communist regime -- and Cubans lost it."" Salazar was referencing island-wide anti-government protests that erupted across Cuba on July 11. A demonstrator reportedly streamed a protest on Facebook, which then went viral and enabled Cubans in other parts of the country to participate in what became the largest anti-government protest on the island in decades. Since protests began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten protesters in the streets. In the immediate aftermath of the protests, the regime shut down nationwide access to the internet and ordered door-to-door raids of homes in the cities that had the largest protest turnout. Salazar, who represents the city of Miami -- or, as she calls it, ""the heart of the Cuban exile community"" in the U.S. -- said liberation in Cuba could become a reality much sooner if the Biden administration would intervene. ""The immediate ask is connectivity and leadership. That doesnt cost money. You dont have to go through Congress. You only need to prove to the world that you are really who you say you are -- the top diplomat and somebody that loves freedom,"" she said, addressing President Joe Biden. Brendan Carr, senior Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), told Breitbart News Sunday host Joel Pollak that U.S. firms can provide internet access to Cuba and circumvent the digital blockade imposed on the one-party island state. Breitbart News reported: ""We have the technical capability to circumvent that Internet blockade [in Cuba], and theres two ways we can do it,"" Carr told Pollak. ""One, we can introduce new Internet connections and services from off-island that can connect directly to the smartphones of the people that are right there in Cuba. Thats path one."" He continued, ""Path two is we need to further bolster the technology that allows Cubans to circumvent the blockade on their own infrastructure. So we need to do both of those, and we can do both of those. Its simply a question of 'Do we have the political will in the Biden administration to give the green light thats necessary for American enterprises to engage in those activities?"" ""The only actual question that matters is [related to] political will,"" he emphasized. ""Do we have the political will to do this? If we do, then the technological issue is not in the way."" The Biden administration publicly said it is considering providing internet to the people of Cuba, though it has taken no action in two weeks. ""If you turn on the wifi, the Cubans will know that they are not alone. They will start communicating among themselves once again, and then they will decide if they want to go back into the streets or not,"" Salazar said. ""Its up to them because thats how everything started on July 11."" On leadership, Salazar said Biden needs to rally the international community to condemn Cubas dictatorship. She also said Biden has the opportunity to ""redress the historical mistake called the 'Bay of Pigs,""' the massacre of dozens of Cuban exiles in April 1961 prompted by President John F. Kennedy promising and not delivering air support to a military invasion against the communist regime, planned -- thanks to Kennedy -- in such a way in which succeeding without air support was impossible. Exiles who did not escape by sea were rounded up and either killed or imprisoned by Castros forces. Kennedys betrayal has largely been blamed for helping to solidify Castros communist regime on the island. ""And look, I am a Republican, but it doesnt matter. We need help from everyone else. This has nothing to do with political parties,"" she said. ""This has to do with a group of Americans helping a group of Cubans that want to have what we have: freedom, civil rights, free market economy, and democracy."" The congresswoman also warned of Americans falling prey to the false promises of socialism and noted Cubans are frustrated because they know ""how bad socialism and how bad communism can be."" ""Thats why were fighting. Thats why I won. Because we know that this Democratic socialism dream that some of my colleagues on the Democratic side are selling -- its a farce. Its not true. It may be noble in theory, but its miserable in practice,"" she said.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/29/2021 0:45,"Rep.

299,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/29/americas/cuba-protests-mass-trials-cmd-intl/index.html,"Havana, Cuba (CNN) Following the most widespread protests since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cubans are now bracing themselves for a new aftershock poised to shake the communist-run island: Mass trials of those who dared to take to the streets calling for change. Fewer than three weeks since the beginning of the unprecedented anti-government demonstrations, the trials are already underway. Not surprisingly, those proceedings are leading to swift convictions. Thousands of Cubans have taken part in rare protests against the communist government, marching and chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty."" Photographer Anyelo Troya said he was running errands when thousands of Cubans streamed into the streets of Havana this month, many chanting ""liberty"" and ""homeland and life,"" a reference to a viral anti-government song . Troya, who had already drawn the ire of Cuban officials for filming part of the music video for that searing opposition anthem, rushed to the protests carrying his camera. ""He was arrested immediately,"" his mother Raisa Gonzalez told CNN. ""He didn't even get a chance to take a photo."" The following week, Troya was put on trial with a dozen other protesters and convicted of instigating unrest. At his sentencing, where he was given a year in prison, Troya's mother said he asked to address the judges. His mother said he told the court he did nothing wrong, asking, ""How is this just when I haven't even seen a lawyer and I am innocent?"" Raisa Gonzalez added, ""Immediately one of the police in civilian clothes came and handcuffed him. I said, 'My love be calm, you are not alone.'"" Cuban officials have refused to say how many people were arrested following the island-wide protests, which came as the Cuban government struggles to deal with increasing shortages of basic goods and surging coronavirus cases. According to the exile group Cubalex which has tracked the arrests, as of July 26, nearly 700 Cubans have been detained since the protests started. Cuban officials have said some protesters who were arrested are being released. Cubalex puts the number of those released at 157. The families of some protesters, who did not want to be identified, told CNN their relatives were arrested merely for being in the street while the protests took place or simply for filming the demonstrations. Many young people in Cuba had not seen protests on such a scale in their lifetime. Stung by criticism that its crackdown on protesters shows a glaring disregard for basic civil liberties, Cuban officials said due process was being followed and that some demonstrators had destroyed property and attacked police. ""Having different opinions, including political ones, doesn't constitute a crime,"" said Ruben Remigio Ferro, the president of the Supreme People's Court of Cuba, at a press conference. ""Thinking differently, questioning what's going on. To demonstrate is not a crime, it's a right granted by the constitution...We are not troglodytes."" But in practice, officials treat any calls for change to the Communist monopoly on power in Cuba -- where opposition parties are outlawed -- as an existential threat. Anti-government protests have gained momentum through the growth of mobile internet in Cuba. The rapid growth of mobile internet in Cuba has opened the way for Cubans to quickly organize and share images of protests. Activists in recent years have tried to hold demonstrations protesting artistic censorship; in favor of LGBTQ rights; and demanding a law banning animal cruelty. But Cuban police, plainclothes state security and baton-toting 'rapid response brigades' have quickly shut down those rare displays of defiance. Only when thousands took to the streets in July did Cuba's security apparatus seem briefly overwhelmed. Cuban officials justified the crackdown on protesters by saying the demonstrations had been fomented by Cuba's Cold War nemesis, the United States. ""When you try to do a movement organized from abroad and aim at trying to create the kind of situation the United States government will use as justification for greater aggression against Cuba, that naturally is not allowed,"" Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, the head of US affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, told CNN. ""That can put in jeopardy the national security of our country."" Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the US government for unprecedented protests across the island. Cuban artists, writers and musicians have decried the arrests and called for an amnesty for non-violent protesters. Facing heavy criticism, the government, in at least a few cases, appears to be backtracking. Following his conviction, Anyelo Troya was released under home arrest while he pursues an appeal. ""I should be 100% free,"" Troya wrote to CNN in a message. Others may not be so lucky. When protesters took to the streets on July 11 in the working-class neighborhood of La Guinera, homemaker Odet Hernandez Cruzata and her husband Reinier Reinosa Cabrera, who before the pandemic worked in nightclubs, joined in, according to their relatives in Cuba and abroad. Odet streamed the protests live on Facebook. In her 22-minute-long video, the crowd can be heard yelling ""homeland and life"" and ""a people united cannot be defeated!"" But as the crowd approaches what they say is a police station, people cry out that shots are being fired at them and to take cover. The Cuban government later said one protester was killed in the neighborhood by officials, who claim the demonstrator attempted to attack them. According to their relatives, Odet and Reinier protested peacefully and returned home. ""They weren't violent, they didn't throw rocks at anyone,"" said Odet's cousin Angelo Padron, who lives in France but has kept in close touch with relatives on the island. ""They didn't commit any violence. Then special troops came to get them at their home. A commando unit with many police."" Padron said the couple is now under arrest and facing serious charges including assault, disorderly conduct, damage to public property and instigation. CNN has not been able to independently verify the charges. Relatives are trying to find the couple a lawyer while they take care of Odet's five-year-old daughter, Padron said. Neither had any prior arrests, he added. While their family assert the couple do not seem to present much of a threat, the Cuban government appears increasingly wary of newly tech-savvy and defiant Cubans. Perhaps because, so far, the video of the protest that Odet live-streamed to Facebook has received more than 124,000 views.",['Patrick Oppmann'],7/29/2021 4:29,"After historic protests, defiant Cubans face mass trials","['cnn', 'streets', 'mass', 'cuban', 'protests', 'troya', 'face', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'defiant', 'officials', 'trials', 'told', 'historic', 'protesters']","Thousands of Cubans have taken part in rare protests against the communist government, marching and chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty.""

300,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/29/politics/biden-cuba-florida-politics/index.html,"(CNN) Democrats in South Florida, beleaguered by a tough 2020 election in the state, have been privately and publicly urging their party leaders to embrace the protests against Cuba's communist regime that are roiling the island nation. Their reasoning is as much personal -- these Democrats believe supporting the protests is the right thing to do -- as it is political -- standing with the Cuban people could help the party regain ground with the state's diverse Hispanic voters, nearly half of whom voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 in a nearly 10-point swing from four years before. Annette Taddeo, a Democratic state senator from Miami-Dade County, has called on President Joe Biden to visit Miami to show solidarity with the rare demonstrations in Cuba, which have brought thousands into the streets calling for freedom, better economic conditions, internet access and an end to the dictatorship. An appearance by the Democratic President, Taddeo told CNN, would go a long way with Cuban American and other Latino voters in South Florida. ""The politics come with being there,"" she said. Florida has long been one of the most prized states in politics, gaining outsized influence because of its size, diversity and the way it swung between Democrats and Republicans for years. In recent years, however, the state has tilted right, backing Trump in 2016 and 2020. Republican inroads Taddeo, a Colombian immigrant, says she has been in touch with officials in the White House and has held public events on the Cuban protests with other prominent South Florida Democrats, such as Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. Despite hopes and even expectations that Biden would replicate former President Barack Obama's foreign policy on Cuba -- normalizing and expanding diplomatic relations, relaxing decades-old travel and trade restrictions -- he has yet to fulfil his campaign promises to roll back the Trump administration's Cuba sanctions or open up relations again. Indeed, six months into Biden's presidency, the White House has yet to complete its review on Cuba polic y. In large part, that's because of Florida politics and a growing concern among Democrats that the inroads Republican made in South Florida in the 2020 election will become an even bigger issue in the coming years -- particularly as the state is set to gain another seat in the House of Representatives after the 2020 census. Asked how much Florida politics are shaping the Biden administration's Cuba policy, administration officials sidestepped the question but stressed their interest in the welfare and freedoms of the Cuban people as well as in increasing US Embassy staffing on the island to better engage with Cuban civil society amid the unprecedented protests It's unclear where the administration's official policy on Cuba will land. But Democrats in Washington are getting the message from South Florida and are emphasizing how tough the administration has been in response to the protests. The Democratic National Committee launched targeted English- and Spanish-language digital ads this week in the Sunshine State that highlight Biden's recent punitive actions against the Cuban government. ""We have a huge opportunity here with a President who is more forceful on Cuba where many Democratic presidents in recent memory may not have been as forceful,"" a senior Democrat said of Biden's response to the Cuban crackdowns. ""There is some real opportunity here. We have something very concrete that, across the ideologic spectrum -- save maybe the farthest of the far left -- is supported."" The Democrat added that many in the party's leadership believe Trump's dominance in South Florida was ""more of an aberration than some sort of liner trajectory for how Democrats can perform in South Florida."" This push from South Florida Democrats like Taddeo reflects how the party is looking for ways to break the GOP's hold on the closely split state. In 2020, Republicans made significant inroads with an array of Latino voters in South Florida, including Cubans, Colombians and Venezuelans. The increase was so significant that Trump was able to become the first Republican presidential candidate since 1976 to lose Duval County in North Florida -- a longtime Republican bastion -- and still win the state by more than 3 percentage points. During the campaign, Republicans portrayed Democrats as soft on communist regimes, emphasizing how Trump had reversed much of the ""thaw"" in US-Cuba relations during Obama's second term. The GOP messaging worked, particularly after Biden said two months before the election that he would roll back Trump's sanctions on Cuba. Dario Moreno, a political science professor at Florida International University, said foreign policy on Cuba has outsized resonance with Florida Latinos, even among the growing non-Cuban Hispanic communities. ""Florida has a very heterogenous Latino population but one of the things that hold them in common ... is a lot of them are fleeing left-wing governments,"" Moreno said. ""Trump cultivated that concern [about Cuba] in South Florida, not only with Cubans but with Colombians and Venezuelans and Nicaraguans."" 'Florida politics is international politics' Even with the direct Biden response, Florida Democrats have a growing sense of dread that the dent Republicans have made in South Florida could become an even bigger issue in the coming years. ""It works,"" Evelyn Perez-Verdia, a veteran Florida Democratic strategist and Colombian American, said about the Republican strategy. ""Sadly enough, we have seen this work in the past with what Trump did with Latino communities. ... From the Democrats that I have talked to, there is a serious concern."" Perez-Verdia said Floridians from the Latino diaspora ""look at everything through the lens of the politics of their country,"" meaning ""Florida politics is international politics"" as much as it is domestic. Democrats are attempting to respond with plans to address US policy toward the island nation, as well as with forceful statements about the democracy movements there. Earlier this month, the Biden administration sanctioned a key Cuban official and a Cuban special forces unit known as the Boinas Negras for human rights abuses in the wake of protests. Biden said sanctions were ""just the beginning,"" pledging that ""the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people."" The President went on to ""condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence."" The DNC's geo-targeted Facebook ads in both English and Spanish highlighted Biden's stance on Cuba and his pledge for more sanctions. Multiple iterations of the ad highlighted Biden saying that communism is a ""failed system."" ""The DNC is committed to using our resources to speak directly to the Cuban community in South Florida to make sure they know that President Biden and Democrats have their back,"" said Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic committee. Politics is unavoidable Asked directly if domestic politics surrounding Florida were playing a role in US foreign policy on Cuba, a senior State Department official said, ""Our focus right now is on the people on the island, making demands of their government for change."" ""We are very interested in the voice of the Cuban people being able to be heard and have expressed concerns about efforts to curtail internet freedom and in communication,"" the official said. ""It is clear that the protests were a result of the Cuban people's exhaustion with the inability of their government to meet their demands and were spontaneous and honest calls for change,"" the official said. ""That really is the key focus of our efforts right now -- determining the best way to support the Cuban people and to hold the government accountable for its actions."" Cuba watchers like John Kavulich, president of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, say domestic politics will always play a role in Cuba -- particularly with Florida set to gain another electoral seat after the latest census. ""US politicians focus on politics, so why is anyone shocked when any politician -- whether it's President Biden, President Trump, President Obama, the first President Bush -- sees it that way? A politician is going to take into account what the constituents want. Cuba is a domestic political issue,"" Kavulich said. ""When people say that the Biden admin should be strong and remove Florida from the Cuba policy decision-making process, it's foolishness. It's not going to happen. The fact that Florida is picking up a seat in the House of Representatives makes it even more important for both political parties,"" Kavulich added.","['Michael Warren', 'Dan Merica', 'Nicole Gaouette']",7/29/2021 11:06,Trump's inroads with Florida Latinos are influencing Democratic response to Cuba,"['influencing', 'trump', 'south', 'president', 'state', 'inroads', 'florida', 'trumps', 'biden', 'cuban', 'democratic', 'cuba', 'democrats', 'politics', 'response', 'latinos']","The Democrat added that many in the party's leadership believe Trump's dominance in South Florida was ""more of an aberration than some sort of liner trajectory for how Democrats can perform in South Florida.""

301,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/29/cuba-responds-protests-3-extra-pounds-rice-rations-no-extra-freedom/,"The Ministry of Interior Commerce in Cuba announced Wednesday that it would increase rice rations by an extra three pounds per person per month, an attempt to quell the eruption of anti-communist unrest that has persisted since July 11. That day, thousands of Cubans nationwide -- in nearly every city on the island -- organized peaceful marches calling for the end of the communist Castro regime, which has used executions, torture, and imprisonment to stay in power since 1959. The scope of the protests attracted international attention and has triggered ongoing protests by Cubans in the diaspora in major capitals around the world, most prominently in Washington, D.C. The protesters chanted slogans like ""freedom"" and anti-communist phrases, plainly stating opposition to the regime. The Communist Party of Cuba has attributed the protests to alleged illicit American intelligence activity, without providing any evidence for U.S. involvement, while international leftist groups sympathetic to the regime have claimed the protesters were objecting to an increasingly dire economic situation in the country that they, too, blamed on the United States. The administration of President Joe Biden adopted the false claim that the protesters were objecting to a deteriorating Chinese coronavirus situation. Attempting to fuel the narrative that the protesters were demanding an improved economic situation, the Ministry of Interior Commerce (MINCIN) announced a giveaway of a paltry three extra pounds of rice per person every month from August to December. Minister Betsy Diaz Velazquez said at a press conference that the extra food rations were in part possible due to humanitarian aid from Russia and Nicaragua, allied leftist regimes. Diaz explicitly connected the rations to the protests, stating the government sought ""in this way to begin giving the population a level of satisfaction at a time in which the imperialism [the United States] is trying to create irritation and disgust among our people and has a high responsibility in what is happening."" !!ULTIMO MINUTO!! Incrementar la oferta de alimentos es una prioridad para el gobierno, muestra de ello es que se entregaran3libras de arroz adicionales mensualmente por persona, garantizadas hasta diciembre, a partir de los ingresos obtenidos por las ventas en MLC. Abrimos hilo pic.twitter.com/N5BELuXvaZ -- Comercio Cuba (@MincinCuba) July 28, 2021 As a communist country, the Cuban Communist Country controls and distributes the nations food supply. Citizens receive ration cards that specify how much food each individual can purchase; it is illegal for individuals to independently decide how much food they need for their homes. Diaz also noted that families would have access to their August food rations early, according to the official newspaper of the Communist Party, Granma. The newspaper added that Diaz announced that it had received extra ""prime materials, like wheat flour, whose destination will be, fundamentally, towards local production industries to increase the output of bread and crackers."" The announcement did not specify any provisions of extra protein other than powdered milk for senior citizens and beans for four different provinces. The independent outlet Cubanet noted Wednesday that the general Cuban population met the announcement with outrage, noting it did nothing to address the core demand of the protesters that the communist regime leaves power. ""Every day they remind me more of Orwells 1984 with this increase by three pounds of the rice [ration] as if that represented the liberty and human rights that the people want, useless bunch of people,"" one social media user highlighted by Cubanet lamented. Diaz, the minister of interior commerce, has been one of the least popular members of the Communist Party leadership for years. Diaz outraged the general population in 2019 in an interview on state television attempting to address shortages created by poor management of food industries by the Party, particularly a shortage of flour that resulted from the government failing to repair aging wheat mills. The government blamed then-President Donald Trump for the shortages, without explaining what role he would have had in the mechanical failures, and cut rations for the majority of citizens. Diaz said on national television that, in addition to the United States, Cuban citizens themselves were responsible for shortages due to hoarding, adding most Cubans supporting receiving less food through the ration system. ""There are a variety of different opinions, most consider these [rations] good and even insist on us continuing to ration products,"" she alleged, prompting widespread indignation. The Castro regime has not supplemented its meager increase in rice rations with any reduction in human rights violations or restoration of basic freedoms for the Cuban people at press time. Following the protests, the regime enacted mass arrests and ordered state security officials to conduct violent door-to-door raids against suspected protesters. Those arrested, human rights groups have alleged, are being subjected to summary judgment trials with no significant due process safeguards. Police have denied the accused in many cases knowledge of what crime they are facing a trial for and access to an attorney. Those sentenced have said they have faced ""summary trials"" alongside as many as 30 other people and sentenced simultaneously. Those outside of prison have accused police of openly threatening them, including children erroneously arrested despite playing no role in the protests. Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez, a 17-year-old sentenced to eight months of house arrest for having witnessed protests she did not participate in, told Cubanet this week -- shortly after her release from one of Cubas most notorious prisons -- that police officers threatened to trap her in a room with two large men who would rape her. She was also subject to a strip search and forced to digitally penetrate herself while squatting in front of guards, allegedly to ensure she was not hiding a weapon. The parents of Yoel Misael Fuentes Garcia, a 16-year-old, told independent outlets last week that police visited the boy in the hospital to threaten him after police shot him on July 11. Fuentes was also not participating in the protests, merely peeking out of his home out of curiosity after hearing the tumult of the crowd. ""We, the relatives, had to see Yoelito through a glass in the hospital. Meanwhile, a police officer went directly to his bed to interrogate and coerce him,"" his stepfather told Diario de Cuba. ""He told him that they could take him to 100 y Aldabo."" 100 y Aldabo is one of Cubas most violent political prisoners and where Zequeira experienced her sexual assault and threats.

John Thys/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo HAVANA, July 29 (Reuters) - The European Union is ""very concerned about the repression"" of protests in Cuba and urges the government to release all arbitrarily detained protesters, the EU said on Thursday in its strongest statement to date on the matter. Summary trials have begun for those detained in unprecedented protests nationwide over shortages, power outages and a lack of freedoms on July 11, amid a deep economic crisis that has been exacerbated by the pandemic and U.S. sanctions. Rights groups have reported around 700 people detained, including several minors. The government has not given its own figures yet but denies that anyone was detained simply for protesting, rather on charges of public disorder, vandalism, contempt of authorities and other offences.

It came three days after the foreign ministers of the United States and 20 other countries including a handful of EU member states condemned the mass arrests. ""We urge (the government) to release all arbitrarily detained protesters, to listen to the voices of its citizens, and to engage in an inclusive dialogue on their grievances,"" Borrell said. The EU has avoided public confrontation with Cuba over human rights issues ever since in 2016 signing a new agreement to normalize relations that no longer sought to coerce the Communist-run Caribbean island into democratic reform. The deal was part of a broader Cuban detente with the West. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter he ""strongly rejected"" the EU statement, which he criticized for not mentioning the ""genocidal U.S. blockade"" for which the government largely blames the country's hardships. Some of Havana's allies like Mexico and Russia have reacted to the protests by denouncing the U.S. trade embargo, and the Organization of American States had to postpone a special meeting on Cuba due to disagreement among member states over its treatment of the matter.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) MEXICO CITY (AP) -- U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with Cuban-American leaders Friday to discuss the recent social protests in Cuba, the possibility of new sanctions on its government and options for providing internet access to the islands population. The afternoon White House meeting, previewed for The Associated Press by an administration official, will take place almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest the shortage of products, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. Among the people who will meet with Biden is Yotuel Romero, one of the authors of the song ""Patria y vida!"" which has become a kind of anthem for the protests, said the official, who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans in public. ADVERTISEMENT Also present will be L. Felice Gorordo, CEO of the company eMerge Americas; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project, and Miamis former mayor, Manny Diaz, among others. The White House did not provide more details, only saying that new sanctions will be discussed as well as ways to establish internet access for the Cuban people. Internet access is a sensitive issue in Cuba. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls for antigovernment demonstrations on social media. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did so. Some U.S. leaders, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have said the White House should do something to maintain internet service in Cuba, including using balloons as Wi-Fi access points for the population. Jose Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watchs director for the Americas, said protecting internet access in Cuba ""must be one of the top priorities"" of the Biden administration. ""The growing access to the internet on the island has been a true revolution that has allowed the population to communicate, organize protests and report abuses almost immediately - something that would have been impossible a few years ago,"" he said to the AP. Regarding the sanctions, Vivanco said their value is ""mostly symbolic,"" because it is not realistic to think that they alone will change the situation on the island. He said one way to stop human rights violations in Cuba is a ""multilateral and coordinated condemnation,"" along with moving toward a policy that puts an end to the current embargo. In addition to the internet, the Biden administration is considering proposals put forward by U.S. advocates of trade with Cuba that would restore ways for Cuban-Americans to send money to relatives on the island. Biden and others have rejected the outright restoration of remittances because of a percentage fee of the transaction paid to the government. But under one proposal being considered, the transfer agents would waive that fee until the end of the year, according to proponents. The proposal would have to be cleared by the Cuban government, however, and it is not at all clear it would agree. Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the Minister of the Cuban Armed Forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""black berets"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. So far it is unclear how many people were detained in total, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people.",['E.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) MIAMI - Yotuel Romero, one of the musicians who created the SOS Cuba protests anthem ""Patria y Vida"", is among the Cubans who are scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden on Friday afternoon at the White Houses State Dining Room and Palm Room. The list also includes Rosa Maria Paya, the daughter of the late Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya; former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party; and L. Felice Gorordo, of eMerge Americas, an annual tech conference. After the July 11 uprising on the communist island and the protests that followed in Florida and Washington, Biden committed to add more sanctions, engage the international community, help provide uncensored internet, review the policy on remittances and restaff the U.S. embassy in Havana. Ad Some protesters in Miami-Dade County have been asking Biden for a U.S. military intervention to help get rid of communism in Nicaragua and Venezuela. Biden said he and his administration was going to listen to leaders in the Cuban American community.

""Earlier this month Cubans took to the street in a show of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials and people disappearing who have spoken out,"" Biden said during the meeting, also detailing US efforts related to remittances, staffing at the US embassy in Cuba and internet access on the island. ""Cuban-Americans are hurting ... because their loved ones are suffering. And it's, quite frankly, intolerable."" The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced the sanctions earlier Friday, designated by the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The sanctions target Cuba's National Revolutionary Police -- the country's primary law enforcement body; Oscar Callejas Valcarce, the director of the police; and Eddy Sierra Arias, the police's deputy director. The sanctions, the Treasury Department said, ""were made in connection with actions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests."" Asked later if the US would issue additional sanctions against Cuba, Biden told reporters, ""There will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate.""

306,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/30/reports-joe-biden-invites-rapper-former-food-blogger-ex-obama-staffer-to-cuba-meeting/,"The administration of President Joe Biden has invited a prominent Cuban rapper, a food blogger turned left-wing policy activist, and a former staffer for President Barack Obama to a meeting on Friday to discuss the ongoing repression of dissidents in Cuba. The White House previewed the guestlist for the event, scheduled for Friday afternoon, to the Associated Press on Thursday. The meeting followed a virtual discussion Biden hosted last week with Cuban-American celebrities Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia, among others, on the issue. ""The White House did not provide more details, only saying that new sanctions will be discussed as well as ways to establish internet access for the Cuban people,"" the AP reported. Protests erupted nationwide in Cuba on July 11 demanding an end to the Communist Partys rule of the island, which began in 1959. The protests consisted almost entirely of peaceful marches and assemblies in every major city of the country and featured attendees clearly chanting ""freedom!"" and other anti-communist slogans. The Castro regime responded to the protests with overwhelming violence, including opening fire on unarmed protesters, publicly beating individuals believed to be participating in protests, and allegedly torturing and sexually assaulting those imprisoned. Human rights activists and members of the Cuban exile community have urged Biden to take action against the regime through sanctions, weapons aid, or restoring internet access to Cuban users after the Castro regime shut it down. Republican lawmakers - many of them representing large Cuban-American populations - have also requested a meeting with the president to discuss moving forward with policies to aid the dissidents. Biden responded by organizing the Estefan Zoom meeting and sanctioning one Cuban official who predecessor Donald Trump had already sanctioned, a move panned as ""symbolic but meaningless."" Bidens meeting Friday will reportedly focus on restoring internet to the island to allow Cubans to share videos of police brutality and other real-time oppression by the Castro regime. At the top of the APs invite list is music artist Yotuel Romero, formerly of the rap group Orishas. Romero is one of several Cuban artists behind the hit single ""Patria y Vida,"" released this February as a protest anthem against the regime. The songs title, which translates to ""Fatherland and Life,"" is an inversion of the Communist Party slogan patria o muerte, meaning ""fatherland or death."" Patria y vida has become a rallying cry and representative slogan of the protest movement in Cuba and the diaspora. Prior to ""Patria y Vida,"" however, Yotuels former group was a darling of the Castro regime. Prior to 2021, the archives of Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, reveal a significant amount of positive coverage of both Romero and the Orishas, fueled by compliant interviews with the rapper himself. Speaking to Granma in 2016 about the Orishas reuniting that year for the first time in eight years, Romero said, ""We always had good relations with our country. For example, in this reunion we have had all the support of Cuban music institutions."" All Cuban artistic institutions are government-run, through the Ministry of Culture; Cuba made it illegal to write songs, draw, or film anything without a preemptive permit from the Ministry in 2019. Romero appeared to confirm his visit to Washington with a post on Instagram Thursday night. Also on the reported guest list for Bidens event is Ana Sofia Pelaez, the co-founder of the Miami Freedom Project, a liberal policy advocacy group. The project claims to advocate for climate change, immigration, and ""racial justice"" issues, all prominent left-wing policy issues and many not especially popular in the overwhelmingly Republican Cuban-American community. Prior to founding the group, Pelaez was most famous as a food writer, having launched her blog Hungry Sofia in 2008. The Associated Press also reported the presence of L. Felice Gorordo, a tech entrepreneur who worked on ""Latino, immigration, and business outreach"" in the Obama White House. Obama-era reports identify Gorordo as a vocal advocate for Obamas disastrous Cuba policy - largely consisting of economic concessions to dictator Raul Castro in the form of enhanced U.S. tourism to the island that resulted in astronomical numbers of politically motivated arrests and oppression on the island. The last name on the Associated Presss list is Manny Diaz, the former mayor of Miami now serving as the chair of the increasingly unpopular Florida Democratic Party. An outlier on the reported guess list, who the Associated Press did not name, is human rights activist Rosa Maria Paya of the Cuba Decide movement. Floridas WPLG Local 10 reported her expected presence at the meeting Friday. Paya, unlike most of the other names on the list, is one of the most prominent voices in the Cuban exile community against communism, organizing efforts in support of free and democratic efforts on the island and advocating for justice in the name of the victims of the regime. Payas father, Oswaldo Paya, founded the islands Christian Liberation Movement, an anti-communist group. The Castro regime is widely believed to have killed Paya and fellow activist Harold Cepero in a car ""accident"" in 2012. The White House has yet to confirm the reported guest list.

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., right, during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, July 30, 2021. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration announced new sanctions on Friday against Cubas national revolutionary police and its top two officials as the U.S. looks to increase pressure on the communist government following this months protests on the island. The Police Nacional Revolcionaria and the agencys director and deputy director, Oscar Callejas Valcarce and Eddie Sierra Arias, were targeted in the latest sanctions announced by the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control. The police are part of Cubas interior ministry, which was already the subject of a blanket designation by the Trump administration back in January. ""We hear the cries of freedom coming from the island. The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" President Joe Biden said at the start of a White House meeting with Cuban Americans not long after Treasury announced the sanctions. The administration says it is considering a wide range of additional options in response to the protests, including providing internet access to Cubans, and has created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that more of the money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the government taking a cut. Biden added that more sanctions were in the offing. ADVERTISEMENT The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. The Cuban regime deployed the PNR to attack protesters, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The police were photographed confronting and arresting protesters in Havana, including members of the Movement of July 11 Mothers, a group founded to organize families of the imprisoned and disappeared, according to Treasury. In Camaguey, a Catholic priest was beaten and arrested by the PNR while he was defending young protesters, according to Treasury. PNR officers also beat a group of peaceful demonstrators, including several minors, and there have also been documented instances in which the PNR used clubs to break up peaceful protests across Cuba, Treasury said. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Andrea Gacki, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""Todays action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights."" Among the Cuban American activists meeting with Biden was Yotuel Romero, one of the authors of the song ""Patria y vida!"" which has become a kind of anthem for the protests, said an official. Others present included L. Felice Gorordo, CEO of the company eMerge Americas; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project, and Miamis former mayor, Manny Diaz, and Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. White House officials said Biden would discuss the new sanctions as well as ways to potentially establish internet access for the Cuban people. Internet access is a sensitive issue in Cuba. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls on social media for anti-government demonstrations. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. ADVERTISEMENT Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. Some U.S. leaders, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have said the White House should do something to maintain internet service in Cuba, including using balloons as Wi-Fi access points for the population. The Biden administration is also considering proposals put forward by U.S. advocates of trade with Cuba that would restore ways for Cuban-Americans to send money to relatives on the island. Biden and others have rejected the outright restoration of remittances because of a percentage fee of the transaction paid to the government. But under one proposal being considered, the transfer agents would waive that fee until the end of the year, according to proponents. The proposal would have to be cleared by the Cuban government, however, and it is not at all clear it would agree. Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the minister of the Cuban armed forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""black berets"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. So far it is unclear how many people were detained, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people. ___ Castillo reported from Mexico City.

308,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/biden-meet-cuban-american-leaders-amid-calls-tougher-action-havana-2021-07-30/,"WASHINGTON, July 30 (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on the Cuban police force and two of its leaders on Friday in response to the Havana government's crackdown on protesters, and President Joe Biden promised Cuban-American leaders more actions were coming. The U.S. Treasury Department said the sanctions, which appeared to be largely symbolic, were a reaction to ""actions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests in Cuba that began on July 11."" Targets of the sanctions are two Cuban police force leaders, as well as the Cuban interior ministry's national police force, the department said. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""There will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate,"" Biden said during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders at the White House. His meeting came as the politically important community calls for more support for protests in Cuba that represent the biggest populist outpouring against the government on the Communist-run island in decades. ""The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" said Biden. Biden said he had asked the Treasury and State departments to report back in a month on how to allow remittance payments from Americans to Cubans without the Cuban government profiting. In addition, Biden has been working on a plan to try to provide wireless communications to Cubans and augment U.S. embassy staff in Cuba, a senior administration official said. The protests erupted this month amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of its old Soviet Union ally and a record surge in coronavirus infections. Thousands took to the streets, angry over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, which in recent years has tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island. He has said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns. U.S. President Joe Biden meets with governors virtually to discuss efforts to strengthen wildfire prevention, preparedness and response efforts, at the South Court Auditorium at the White House complex in Washington, U.S., July 30, 2021. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Last week, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions on Cuba's defense minister and an interior ministry special forces unit over allegations of human rights abuses in the crackdown that followed the protests, which saw hundreds of activists detained. Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have urged more measures. Participants in Friday's meeting included Yotuel Romero, a hip hop musician and author of ""Patria y Vida,"" a song that has become the anthem for the protesters; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project; and former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz. CUBAN AMERICANS SEEK TOUGHER POLICY Florida's 1.5 million Cuban Americans voted heavily for Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Winning back their support is crucial for Biden's Democratic Party to clinch the swing state in the 2024 presidential election. ""I think if Biden has a successful Cuban policy that is able to put the regime on the defensive and provide concrete support to Cubans, that will benefit him with voters in Florida,"" said John Suarez, executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba. ""If the regime collapses on his watch, that could be a game changer."" Guennady Rodriguez, 40, who said he moved to Miami from Cuba in 2013, said he thought Biden had moved too slowly in addressing Cuban policy in the months before the protests. The Biden administration has been engaged in a lengthy review of the Cuban policy it inherited from the Donald Trump administration. Rodriguez said Biden was unlikely to please Cuban-American hardliners without running afoul of liberal voters. ""Biden has put himself in a lose-lose position. Now it is going to be more difficult for him to select an engagement policy,"" he said. Alejandro Ortiz, 32, who also moved to Miami from Cuba, said he thought Biden's response to the Cuban government after the protests was too slow. ""I see an attitude that is a little passive,"" he said. ""He needed to be faster and more severe with his measures.""

(Photo by Eva Marie UZCATEGUI / AFP) (Photo by EVA MARIE UZCATEGUI/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON - The Biden administration imposed another round of sanctions on Cuba's police force and its leaders for the violent suppression of peaceful protests that broke out on the island more than two weeks ago. The Treasury sanctions designate Cuban police director Oscar Callejas Valcarce and his deputy, Eddy Sierra Arias, as well as the island's police force. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regime's involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" wrote Andrea Gacki, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a statement announcing the sanctions. ""Today's action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban people's calls for freedom and respect for human rights,"" the statement added. Last week, Washington slapped sanctions on Cuba's defense minister and the communist nation's special forces brigade for the suppression of peaceful protests that broke out on the island. The U.S. sanctions were coupled with a warning that there would be more to come if the Cuban government did not rectify the situation. ""This is just the beginning - the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" President Joe Biden said in a July 22 statement. Earlier this month, thousands of protestors filled the streets over frustrations with a crippled economy hit by food and power shortages. The rare protests, the largest the communist country has seen since the 1990s, come as the government struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic, pushing the island's fragile health-care system to the brink.",['Amanda Macias'],7/30/2021 20:02,Treasury slaps sanctions on Cuban police force and its leaders over crackdown on protests,"['sanctions', 'leaders', 'force', 'treasury', 'rights', 'communist', 'cuban', 'protests', 'freedom', 'suppression', 'cubas', 'statement', 'crackdown', 'slaps']","The Treasury sanctions designate Cuban police director Oscar Callejas Valcarce and his deputy, Eddy Sierra Arias, as well as the island's police force.

310,https://www.local10.com/news/2021/07/30/biden-administration-imposes-sanctions-targeting-cuban-leaders-for-violating-human-rights/,"WASHINGTON - The Biden administration targeted two individuals and the islands national police force in another round of sanctions on Friday, following the violent response to peaceful protestors during the historic protests on the communist island July 11. Cuban Police director Oscar Callejas Valcarce, his deputy Eddy Sierra Arias and the National Police Force, la Policia Nacional Revolucionaria, are facing human rights violations and sanctions, blocking the ownership of property or interests in the United States, in any way associated with the individuals or the communist regime on the island. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Andrea M. Gacki. ""Todays action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights,"" the statement continued. Ad The administration says it is considering a wide range of additional options in response to the protests, including providing internet access to Cubans, and has created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that more of the money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the government taking a cut. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls on social media for antigovernmental demonstrations. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. Ad Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the minister of the Cuban armed forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""boinas regras"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. Several Cuban Americans were in attendance during Fridays meeting, including entertainers Emilio Estefan, Yotuel Romero and former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, now the Chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. Diaz applauded the sanctions. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Ad Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. Human rights groups report more than 700 arrests and 500 people still in custody following the protests, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people. The communist regime blames America and the economic embargo for the recent protests, but U.S. leaders pushed back saying they were the result of the countrys economic crisis.","['Ben Kennedy', 'Veronica Crespo', 'Associated Press']",7/30/2021 21:33,Biden administration imposes sanctions targeting Cuban leaders and national police for violating human rights,"['sanctions', 'rights', 'leaders', 'national', 'imposes', 'biden', 'communist', 'cuban', 'protests', 'human', 'twitter', 'united', 'targeting', 'authorities', 'violating', 'took']","WASHINGTON - The Biden administration targeted two individuals and the islands national police force in another round of sanctions on Friday, following the violent response to peaceful protestors during the historic protests on the communist island July 11.

311,https://nypost.com/2021/07/30/biden-says-us-will-hit-cuba-with-more-sanctions-unless-theres-drastic-change/,"President Biden on Friday vowed to heap new sanctions on Cubas Communist leaders unless theres ""drastic change"" in the wake of large anti-government protests. Biden made the threat as he hosted a group of Cuban-Americans at the White House -- following weeks of noisy protests on Pennsylvania Ave, including a large and loud overnight protest into the wee hours of Monday. ""There will be more [sanctions] unless theres some drastic change in Cuba, which I dont anticipate,"" Biden told reporters at the Friday event. Biden said that Cubas repression of protests was ""intolerable"" and said that new sanctions are likely to target police on the island. But the broadcast of Bidens message was limited. The White House did not set up a live video feed for the Friday afternoon event and did not immediately provide reporters with a list of Cuban-Americans who participated. President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington. Susan Walsh/AP Biden last week authorized sanctions against Cuban Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Cuban Interior Ministrys special forces brigade, nicknamed the ""Black Berets."" Former President Donald Trump imposed sanctions against the entire Cuban Interior Ministry, including the brigade, in January, the Treasury Department said. It does not appear that those sanctions were lifted by Biden. Its unclear why Biden did not order sanctions against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who called the protesters ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"" and oversaw this months crackdown. Bidens original sanctions on Cuba sanctions have targeted Cuban Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Interior Ministrys special forces brigade. Susan Walsh/AP Critics have called on the commander-in-chief to do more amid the suppression of protests -- and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told The Post last week that Republicans are weighing legislation to force the presidents hand. Biden previously said the US is investigating whether its possible to override an internet blackout imposed by Cuban authorities. The lack of internet access prevents distribution of information on protests.",['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],7/30/2021 22:40,Biden says US will hit Cuba with more sanctions unless there's 'drastic change',"['sanctions', 'president', 'interior', 'white', 'change', 'biden', 'week', 'cuban', 'brigade', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'theres', 'unless', 'hit', 'drastic']","President Biden on Friday vowed to heap new sanctions on Cubas Communist leaders unless theres ""drastic change"" in the wake of large anti-government protests.

Yotuel Romero, 44, a member of Cuban hip hop group Orishas, worked with Gente de Zona on ""Patria y Vida"" to give a voice to the opposition on the island. On Thursday, Yotuel shared a picture on Instagram of the beginning of his journey to the White House. The ex-pat, who is married to a Spanish actress and singer, lives between Miami and Madrid. He wore a navy blue suit and tie on Friday to the White House. Before the meeting with Biden, the musician met with Sen. Bob Menendez, a Cuban American who serves as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Menendez, 67, was also invited to the meeting. Ad The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Twitter account shared this photograph of Yotuel Romero, 44, left, and Sen. Bob Menendez, 67, right, on Friday. (Senate Foreign Relations Committee) The two showed up to the White House early to go to the medical unit to get tested for the coronavirus before they were allowed in the historic State Dining Room. Once they tested negative, they made it to the meeting. Estefan had been there before as a music producer and he recently participated in a virtual meeting with two White House officials. He wore a pin on his lapel with the U.S. and Cuban flags. ""Today is a very important day to send a message of freedom, hope, and democracy,"" Estefan, 68, wrote in Spanish on Instagram. ""Not only for Cuba, but also for Venezuela Nicaragua, and all countries with dictatorships that deserve to be free. Hopefully this meeting that several people are attending is positive and encourages us to make the right decisions."" Once inside the State Dining Room, the furniture was set up for a roundtable discussion. Everyone wore black face masks. There were long ivory table cloths, place cards, and individual microphones. There was social distancing. Biden sat in the middle. Ad He announced his administrations latest sanctions against two Cuban officials -- Oscar Callejas Valcarce, the director of the Cuban police and his deputy, Eddy Sierra Arias -- and the Policia Nacional Revolucionaria. After the meeting, Estefan said he felt there was progress and Biden understands protestors are not just asking for food; they are asking for freedom. ""I was really impressed that he took the time and he asked so many questions, and I think every speech that went there had different ideas, but what we all want is a free Cuba,"" Estefan said. Former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz described Biden as ""a human being who really cares."" He said every individual sanction sends a message. ""As we understand it, there are more to come,"" Diaz said. Ad Felice Gorordo, the chief executive officer of eMerge Americas, also participated. To commemorate the unforgettable experience, Gorordo, Yotuel, Estefan, former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, and other participants posed for a group photo. ""My takeaway: @POTUS & the entire Admin is more determined than ever before to support the Cuban people & hold the regime accountable,"" Gorordo wrote on Twitter. ""#Cuba IS a top national security priority & theyre taking a whole of government approach to #SOSCuba."" Profoundly grateful to @POTUS for his leadership at this critical moment for #Cuba. Incredibly appreciative for meeting with Cuban American leaders today at the @WhiteHouse to discuss how we can best support our brothers & sisters on the island. #Libertad #SOSCuba #PatriaYVida pic.twitter.com/QSIEQGc5AR -- Felice Gorordo (@fgorordo) July 30, 2021 Bidens remarks during the meeting Well, Im honored to welcome members of the Cuban American community, and Senator Menendez, Senator [Congressman] Meeks to discuss how the United States is going to continue to stand with the Cuban people, who have suffered for decades and decades under a failed communist regime. Earlier this month, Cubans took to the street in a historic demonstration of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials, and people disappearing who -- who have spoken out. Just disappearing. Ad Family members, Im told, are not able -- have no idea where their family members are back in Cuba. And -- in a brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people. The Cuban Americans are hurting. Theyre hurting because their loved ones are suffering. And its, quite frankly, intolerable. So, I want the Cuban Americans to know that we -- all around this table and myself included -- see your pain, we hear your voices, and we hear the cries of freedom coming from the island. The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people. Weve brought to bear the strength of our diplomacy, rallying nations to speak out and increase pressure on the regime. And were holding the regime accountable. Last week, we sanctioned the head of Cuban armed forces and the government -- a government entity called the ""Black Berets"" for their involvement in suppressing protesters. And, today, we are adding sanctions against the Revolutionary National Police, as well as individual sanctions against the chief and deputy chief -- the chief and deputy chief. And were going to continue to add sanctions on individuals that carry out -- that carry out the regimes abuses. Ad At the same time, were increasing direct support for the Cuban people by pursuing every option available to provide Internet access to help the Cuban bypass -- the Cuban people bypass the censorship thats being mandatorily imposed. You always know something is not going well when the -- a country will not allow -- will not allow their people to be engaged in -- be on the Internet and being able to make their case known around the world. And were expanding our assistance to political prisoners and dissidents. And the direct State -- and Ive directed the State Department and the Treasury Department to provide me, within one month, recommendations of how to maximize the flow of remittances to the Cuban people, without the Cuban military taking their cut. And were working to increase U.S. staffing at our embassy while prioritizing the safety of our personnel. So, weve got a lot to discuss with this group. So, we got -- and mostly, Im here to listen. I want to know what their ideas are. And you are some of the best experts on the issue. The first person to bring this to my attention and to make sure that we were on top of this was Senator Menendez. And we think that -- you know, the American -- the Cuban American people are actually the best ambassadors for the Cuban people. Ad And so, my administration is going to make sure that their voices are included and uplifted at every step of the way. And were going to get down to business. So, thank you all for bothering to come in. I appreciate it. For more news on Cuba visit the Local 10 News page in Spanish.

313,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/31/us-puts-new-sanctions-on-cuba-as-biden-meets-cuban-americans,"The administration says it is considering a range of additional options including providing internet access to Cubans. The Biden administration announced new sanctions on Friday against Cubas National Revolutionary Police and its top two officials, as the US looks to increase pressure on the communist government following this months protests on the island. The Police Nacional Revolcionaria and the agencys director and deputy director, Oscar Callejas Valcarce and Eddie Sierra Arias, were targeted in the latest sanctions announced by the Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control. The police are part of Cubas interior ministry, which was already the subject of a blanket designation by the Trump administration back in January. ""We hear the cries of freedom coming from the island. The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" President Joe Biden said at the start of a White House meeting with Cuban-Americans not long after Treasury announced the sanctions.

Biden added that more sanctions were in the offing. The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest against shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. The Cuban regime deployed the PNR to attack protesters, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The police were photographed confronting and arresting protesters in Havana, including members of the Movement of July 11 Mothers, a group founded to organise families of the imprisoned and disappeared, according to Treasury. White House officials said Biden would discuss the new sanctions as well as ways to potentially establish internet access for the Cuban people. Internet access is a sensitive issue in Cuba. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls on social media for anti-government demonstrations. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the US have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the protests, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. The Biden administration is also considering proposals put forward by US advocates of trade with Cuba that would restore ways for Cuban Americans to send money to relatives on the island. Floridas 1.5 million Cuban Americans voted heavily for Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Winning back their support is crucial for Bidens Democratic Party to clinch the swing state in the 2024 presidential election.

""If the regime collapses on his watch, that could be a game-changer."" Guennady Rodriguez, 40, who said he moved to Miami from Cuba in 2013, said he thought Biden had moved too slowly in addressing Cuban policy in the months before the protests. The Biden administration has been engaged in a lengthy review of the Cuban policy it inherited from the Donald Trump administration. Rodriguez said Biden was unlikely to please Cuban-American hardliners without running afoul of liberal voters. ""Biden has put himself in a lose-lose position. Now, it is going to be more difficult for him to select an engagement policy,"" he said. Alejandro Ortiz, 32, who also moved to Miami from Cuba, said he thought Bidens response to the Cuban government after the protests was too slow. ""I see an attitude that is a little passive,"" he said. ""He needed to be faster and more severe with his measures.""",['Be Len Fer Nan Dez'],7/31/2021 0:32,Biden meets with Cuban Americans as US imposes new Cuba sanctions,"['sanctions', 'americans', 'imposes', 'policy', 'access', 'white', 'biden', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'meets', 'administration']","White House officials said Biden would discuss the new sanctions as well as ways to potentially establish internet access for the Cuban people.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, July 30 (Reuters) - Cuba this week received shipments of food and medical supplies from allies Mexico, Russia and Bolivia in a bid to ease shortages and discontent amid the island's worst economic crisis in decades and a surge in coronavirus cases. The donations, which authorities started distributing on Friday, come nearly three weeks after unprecedented protests broke out nationwide, spurred by frustrations with dire economic conditions and curbs on civil freedoms. Cuba blames the unrest on U.S.-backed mercenaries exploiting hardships it says were largely brought about by decades of U.S. sanctions and disguising attempts at unrest through the campaign #SOSCuba calling for humanitarian aid.

On Friday, a Mexican navy ship carrying 1,000 tonnes of beans as well as medical equipment and oxygen for COVID-19 patients arrived in the country, which currently has one of the highest infection rates per capita in the world. Two more will arrive shortly, Interior Commerce Minister Betsy Diaz said late on Friday on state television. ""I want to personally thank President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who ... has ratified Mexico's traditional rejection of the blockade and its will to help Cuba,"" Cuban Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca said at the ship-receiving ceremony. Pedro Monreal, author of a popular blog on Cuban economics, said the relief was ""positive as an emergency measure"" given the seriousness of the simultaneous health, economic and political crises. ""This has a humanitarian and political angle,"" he said. ""But when you look at the long term, its relative weight is low."" Ricardo Torres, an economist with the Havana-based Center for the Study of the Cuban Economy, calculated, for example, that Vietnam's promised donation of around 12,000 tonnes of rice would yield some 2 pounds per Cuban.

315,https://havanatimes.org/features/the-protests-in-cuba-from-a-diplomatic-standpoint/,"Screenshot from a video taken in front of the Cuban Radio & Television Institute building on July 11, 2021. While many governments expressed concern over the violent Cuban government crackdown against peaceful protestors, they also oppose the US embargo on the island. By Laura Roque Valero (El Toque) HAVANA TIMES -The day after the demonstrations on Sunday, July 11, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, assured on national TV ""I can say that in general, the world has reacted with great respect and trust, which comes from knowing Cubas impeccable track record, always truthful and always transparent."" What has transpired the following days should oblige the foreign minister to qualify his discourse. The first declarations came from Cubas allies. On Monday July 12, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro expressed his support for Diaz Canels Government, while his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, forewarned threats of ""imperialist destabilization"" in the demonstrations in Cuba. Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, at first avoided commenting in his customary Morning Meetings on Cubas internal matters and self-determination. At the same time, he offered to send vaccines and humanitarian aid. Days later he made known his proposal to consider Cuba the ""Patrimoney of Humanity"" seeing it as an ""example of resistance"" in relation to the US blockade. However, from the moment the demonstrations began, other dignitaries noted that the protesters complaints should be heard. At the core are the declarations from the United States, due to the historic conflict between the two countries, and because thats where the largest community of Cuban ex-patriots is located. Shortly after the protests, President Joe Biden joined the call for freedom in a press release from the White House: ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" On July 12th, Wendy Morton, the United Kingdoms Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for European Neighborhood and the Americas, called for calm and openness so that the Cubans can express their opinions. On July 21, the UKs ambassador in Havana, Antony Stokes, met with vice-minister Anayansi Rodriguez of Cubas Foreign Ministry (Minrex) to discuss a wide range of topics, among them ""the right to peaceful protests, acts of violence, detentions, internal and external blockades, attacks on social networks, internet shutdowns, fake news, freedom of the press,"" in addition to Cuban vaccines, cooperation in regards to the pandemic, travel restrictions, and other bilateral and multilateral matters. Less reserved, Jair Bolsonaro, President of Brazil, referred from the very beginning to a ""cruel dictatorship"" that ""massacres"" freedom and ""peddles to the world the fantasy of a socialist paradise."" On July 13, Lithuania, Peru, Spain and Sweden followed the development of events expressing concern about the deteriorating situation in Cuba and supporting the right to protest. Chiles Foreign Ministry stated in a press release that there was no justification for silencing Cuban citizens with repressive measures. The following day, Portugal, Germany, Colombia and Uruguay also came out against the violence, and troubled by the first officially recognized death resulting from the protests. The concern regarding respect for human rights and democracy were repeated in these messages. On July 15, the communiques focused on the court proceedings against the demonstrators and their irregularities. The Netherlands and Switzerland called for releasing those who participated peacefully in July 11 protests. Also on July 15, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) condemned the repression and the use of force: ""The Commission maintains that official statements branding demonstrators as enemies are inadmissible and reckless. These statements stigmatize protest, foster an atmosphere that tolerates violence, may encourage clashes between citizens, and are incompatible with international standards to protect the right to protest,"" pointing out the duty of the Cuban State to guarantee this right, and its contemptable response of criminalizing it. Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed similar worries about the arrests and the use of excessive force against the demonstrators, and urged the Government to restore access to the Internet and social networks. Costa Rica, Ecuador, Canada, Poland and the Czech Republic also agreed about the lack of freedom and political rights of Cubans in relationship to their government. They petitioned for democracy, the end of repression, and for dialogue. Another point of agreement in several documents was to call for the end of the US embargo against the island. Poland, whose embassy in Havana has echoed the demand for the release of artist Hamlet Lavastida made by his 7-year-old son Leo, announced via its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a meeting with the Cuban ambassador in Varsovia, Jose Marti Martinez, in which (in addition to acknowledge the increase in bilateral commerce) the Polish vice-minister Przydacz communicated his profound distress over the recent events in Cuba, demanding an end to the repression and the creation of a dialogue. In response to the international reaction, Cubas diplomacy focuses on the ones in their favor. FM Bruno Rodriguez, summing up a conversation with his Canadian counterpart, Marc Garneau, said that Cuba expressed its concern over human rights violations to native peoples in Canada. Communication from Canada, however, states that Garneau expressed ""profound preoccupation for the violent repression of the protests in Cuba, in particular the repressive measures against peaceful demonstrators, journalists and activists, and the arbitrary detentions."" In addition to these individual statements, on July 25 a joint statement was issued by the Governments of Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Guatemala, Greece, Honduras, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Korea, Ukraine, and the United States of America. ""On July 11, tens of thousands of Cuban citizens participated in peaceful demonstrations across the country to protest deteriorating living conditions and to demand change. They exercised universal freedoms of expression and assembly, rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the European Convention on Human Rights. ""We call on the Cuban government to respect the legally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the Cuban people without fear of arrest and detention. We urge the Cuban government to release those detained for exercising their rights to peaceful protest. We call for press freedom and for the full restoration of Internet access, which allows economies and societies to thrive. We urge the Cuban government to heed the voices and demands of the Cuban people. ""The international community will not waver in its support of the Cuban people and all those who stand up for the basic freedoms all people deserve."" This declaration is a word for word match to a message that the Cuban Foreign Minister leaked on his Twitter account a few days earlier. Rodriguez announced that the United States, with Bolsonaros support, was pressuring European and Latin American countries to sign on. The final number, 21 signatories, is not an earth-shattering number for an international community comprising 190 countries. Yet, it is noteworthy that countries such as Greece, Austria and Cyprus, which rarely comment on Cubas political system, signed along with countries that abstained (Colombia and Ukraine) in the recent vote against the US embargo, in the UN General Assembly. According to some analysts, most of the worlds governments that have come out against the repression of peaceful demonstrators in Cuba prefer not to combine it with rhetoric like ""failed State,"" which the Biden administration brandishes. This is because they are also critical of the embargo, so they prefer to speak solely about civil rights in Cuba. Obviously, they have not remained silent.

316,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/02/cuba-human-rights-activists-confirm-1000-arrests-disappearances-since-july-11/,"The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), a non-governmental organization that tracks detentions on the island, documented over 1,000 disappearances or arrests in Cuba between July 11, the day nationwide protests began on the island, and August 1. The July 11 protests triggered a global rallying cry for international action to end the 62-year-old Castro regime, which continues to maintain a stranglehold on the island despite attempts to portray President Miguel Diaz-Canel as a new leader distinct from the Castro family rulers embedded in the Communist Partys most powerful military positions. The protests themselves, occurring in as many as 40 different municipalities across the country, were the largest Cuba has experienced in years and followed extensive civil society organizing by various pro-democracy groups since at least the 2003 ""Black Spring"" crackdown. While the July 11 protests were, by all accounts, overwhelmingly peaceful, Cuban authorities responded by deploying state security and its repressive ""black beret"" special forces to conduct mass arrests, open fire on crowds of dissidents, and perform public beatings to scare anyone considering joining the movement. Diaz-Canel also appeared on television on the night of July 11 issuing an ""order of combat"" to civilians sympathetic with the regime, encouraging them to physically attack anyone they considered may support the protests. Dissidents on the island have described the nearly three weeks since the July 11 protests as intensely violent. The ""black beret"" forces have conducted door-to-door raids looking for suspected protesters in nearly every major city and shot protesters in their own homes. The legal system is so overwhelmed, according to the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders, that courts are processing and sentencing as many as 30 people at once with no regard for differences in their cases and, in many cases, not granting them access to an attorney. Initial reports from Cuban journalists working on the island suggested that police had detained as many as 5,000 people in the immediate aftermath of July 11. Activists still insist this week that the true toll of those missing and arresting remains incomplete as so many remote towns in the interior of the country engaged in protests and so many of those marching are not known active dissidents with networks outside of the country. As of Monday, however, the OCDH tally is the largest known confirmed number of people missing or in police custody since protests began. According to the NGO, 1,004 Cubans remain missing or arrested as of July 11, the vast majority of them (795) men. At least 21 of those arrested or disappeared are children, the group noted, describing the last few weeks in Cuba as ""20 days of savage repression."" 1004 detenciones/desapariciones en #Cuba desde #11J 20 dias de represion salvaje 795 hombres (16 de ellos menores de edad) 209 mujeres (5 de ellas menores de edad). pic.twitter.com/PBBPjGrU5q -- Observatorio Cubano de Derechos Humanos (@observacuba) August 1, 2021 Cuban police appeared to arrest some of the most internationally known political dissidents first as protests began. Still missing, with no proof of life, is the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) Jose Daniel Ferrer. UNPACU is believed to be the largest pro-democracy group on the island, but no evidence suggests that Ferrer played any role in the protests. Ferrer is a veteran of the ""Black Spring"" arrests of 2003 and often faces arrest and disappearance, most recently disappeared in October 2019 and resurfacing 6 months later accusing the regime of torture and medical neglect in prison. The regime sentenced Ferrer to four years of house arrest in April 2020. Ferrer disappeared in far-east Santiago de Cuba. Also missing is the founder of the pro-democracy collective the San Isidro Movement, Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara. Oteros group was largely responsible for organizing large protests at the Ministry of Culture headquarters in Havana last year and suffers severe persecution, even though Otero himself has said that they ""do not want to topple the dictatorship."" Cuban police also appeared to disproportionately target religious leaders. The Cuban Communist Party is an atheist organization and has engaged in decades of intense persecution against Christians on the island. Groups like the santeria movement, who practice a syncretic religion largely based on Yoruba Nigerian paganism, have also endured persecution even among decades of rumors that Fidel Castro himself dabbled in santeria practices. In one particularly violent incident, Cuban authorities publicly beat a Catholic priest, Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, and cracked his head before detaining him in his native Camaguey, which experienced some of the largest July 11 protests. Police released Alvarez only after receiving international condemnation and, in his message following his release, the clergyman clearly sported visible injuries to the head. Still missing are several members of the Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba, a santeria group that refuses to worship under the auspices of the atheist Communist Party. According to the Global Liberty Alliance, a human rights advocacy group, at least six members were arrested for participating in protests. The OCDH estimated in a report published in July that Cuban repressive forces have performed over 30,000 politically motivated arrests in the last five years, many repeat incidents against the islands most vocal dissidents.

317,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/03/cuba-threatens-attack-america-we-are-armed/,"The official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, Granma, published a commentary on Tuesday warning President Joe Biden that the regime ""has the weapons ... to repel any aggression"" and is willing to engage in a conflict with America. Biden has not adopted a coherent policy towards Cuba, which for the past 62 years has endured the repression of a violent, anti-American communist regime. Following nationwide protests calling for the end of communism on July 11, which some estimates suggest attracted nearly 200,000 participants nationwide, Cuban-Americans on the mainland have encouraged Biden to consider various avenues of humanitarian and military aid for the protesters. Those asking Biden to implement a Cuba policy were in part reacting to the Castro regimes response to the protests, largely defined by police brutality including violent door-to-door raids, torture and sexual abuse of prisoners, public beatings, and opening fire on peaceful crowds. Castro regime figurehead Miguel Diaz-Canel issued a call on national television on the evening of July 11 for civilians to violently assault anyone considered a ""counterrevolutionary,"" labeling it an ""order of combat"" in defense of the ""revolution."" Biden has so far responded to the ongoing protests in Cuba by holding a meeting with Cuban-American celebrities and sanctioning three individuals already under sanctions set in place by former President Donald Trump. The column in Granma on Tuesday accused Biden, despite his lack of decisive action towards the regime, of being ""poorly advised, erratic, irresolute,"" and ""an ally of the Republican right and Trumpism."" ""Anti-Cuban lawmakers ... Miami haters, supported by representatives of the Trumpist far-right of the United States, fueled by the resentment that defines them, continue to demand that the government of Joe Biden intervene militarily in Cuba,"" the article read. ""A wave of bellicose hysteria sweeps the media and, above all, social media. We have seen the very images of Dantes circles of Hell, where some of the enthusiasts promoting death will end up going."" The Cuban Communist Party is officially an atheist entity and does not recognize the existence of Hell. The column concluded warning Biden that the Castro regime would embrace a war with the United States. ""We are lovers of peace, we want to build a prosperous future for our children and grandchildren, we want fair relations, based on principles, with your country,"" the column said, addressing Biden. ""But we are not an unarmed people, Mr. Biden, we have weapons and, more importantly, the souls ready to repel any aggression. Do not be fooled: the adventure would be unpayable for you."" The official position of the Cuban Communist Party is that the protests of July 11, which swept dozens of cities nationwide, were a U.S. intelligence operation organized by Cuban-American terrorists, not a legitimate manifestation of the Cuban people. Juventud Rebelde, another state propaganda outlet, described the protests as ""actions against the Cuban Revolution ... oriented from the United States by elements of the Cuban-American right to try to destabilize the country."" Another propaganda outlet, the Havana Tribune, referred to the overwhelmingly peaceful protests as an act of foreign ""terrorism."" Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez has both accused American agents of instigating the protests and denied any violence against protesters, complaining that he has seen ""worse [repression] in Europe,"" without offering any examples. The U.S. State Department formally recognizes the Castro regime as a state sponsor of terrorism alongside Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Cubas most well-documented terrorist tie is with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a narco-terrorist organization whose leaders lived in Havana for years following a joint U.S. campaign with the administration of former President Alvaro Uribe that largely disabled the group in the 2000s. With Raul Castros intervention, another Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, offered the FARC a ""peace deal"" that allowed the leaders to return home as senators, fueling a drug and violence boom in the country ongoing today. The Cuban Communist Party is also a close ally of Irans and is known to have ties to the jihadist organization Hezbollah. A leaked Obama-era intelligence report from 2016 warned that Hezbollah could launch attacks against America from Cuba. That same year, a leak from the now-defunct law firm Mossack Fonseca known as the Panama papers revealed that Cuba had bankrolled an operation to grant Hezbollah members legitimate Venezuelan passports, despite them being citizens of Mideast states with no ties to Venezuela, allowing them to move more freely in the Western Hemisphere. Cuba is also formally an ally of several enemies of the United States, most prominently Russia and China. A report published last week by the independent outlet ADN Cuba revealed that Chinas Peoples Armed Police (PAP) had aided Cuba by training its ""black berets,"" a repressive police force used to disappear political dissidents. Chinese state media had openly admitted to using the PAP for law enforcement outreach in Cuba over a decade ago.

318,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/04/cuba-continues-home-invasions-against-protesters-three-weeks-after-national-marches/,"Communist state security forces in Cuba have not ceased raiding the homes of and arresting individuals believed to have participated in the July 11 nationwide protests, most recently disappearing dissident Sadiel Gonzalez from his home on Monday night. Gonzalezs family told the independent Cuban outlet 14 y Medio that Gonzalez remains missing as of Tuesday following police entering his Havana home on Monday night and requesting an ""interview"" at the police station. Gonzalez had broadcast a live stream on Facebook of the protests on July 11 and participated in them. Unlike many who have been arrested or otherwise disappeared into the Communist Party criminal system, Gonzalez has a track record of dissident activity and had most recently participated in a protest in April prior to July 11. Gonzalezs arrest became publicly known because he filmed the visit by police on Monday -- which reportedly occurred after 9 p.m. local time, past the curfew imposed to prevent the spread of Chinese coronavirus in the capital city. Police did not present a warrant for his arrest or state that he would face any charges, leaving unclear why they came to his home. Video Gonzalez posted on Facebook showed an officer asking Gonzalez to accompany the police to ""have a conversation at the police station"" but authorities ultimately place him in handcuffs and take him away. Responding to outraged demands for an explanation from his mother, one officer reportedly says, ""its for an interview, mom, dont worry about it."" Another officer, following Gonzalezs departure in a police car, told his mother that the man was ""involved in counterrevolutionary acts"" and explained that he had livestreamed video of himself on Monday promoting more protests against the Castro regime. The arrest on Monday offers proof that persecutions related to the July 11 protests continue three weeks later, even as calls for international aid to the protesters, particularly in the United States, have largely fallen on deaf ears. The administration of President Joe Biden implemented redundant sanctions on two individuals in response to the violent crackdowns following July 11, but has not taken any more significant measures and, following a meeting last week with Cuban celebrities, has not indicated he has plans for more action in the future. The July 11 protests were a spontaneous eruption of discontent against the communist regime, in power for 62 years, that occurred in nearly every city in the country. Some estimates suggest as many as 200,000 Cubans participated in the protests, which mostly consisted of peaceful marches and assemblies in public squares. The Castro regime responded to the protests by immediately demanding that pro-revolutionary civilians physically assault dissidents in public and executing door-to-door raids to arrest suspected protesters. Some police officers used live ammunition to fire into peaceful crowds; many arrested individuals near protests for whom there was no evidence of participation, including children. According to the human rights group Cuban Prisoners Defenders in a report published this week, ""an impossible-to-determine number between 2,000 and 8,000 people"" were detained and remain in police custody as a result of police activity last month, the vast majority of it on July 11 or in the days following. The organization noted that, in the vast majority of these cases, the individuals imprisoned do not receive due process, meaning many have not even been charged with a crime while remaining under police custody. Underlining this lack of respect for legal rights, Prisoners Defenders could only confirm the existence of 272 political prisoners on the island as of June, defined as individuals tried and convicted of crimes consisting of disagreements with the government. The rest are merely in police custody without being convicted -- or in many cases indicted -- of a crime. Yet another alarming category of prisoner are dissidents serving time for ""pre-criminal"" behavior. According to Cuban Prisoners Defenders, 11,000 Cubans fit this category. These are individuals the regime considers a threat but for whom no evidence of any act that can be interpreted in any way as a crime exists. Another significant group of people the Communist Party deems enemies of the state are consistently beholden to informal house arrest arrangements. This method is especially used in the cases of journalists. Luz Escobar, the 14 y Medio reporter who wrote the story on Gonzalezs arrest, regularly reports being unable to leave her home for unclear reasons. On Wednesday, Escobar filmed a suspected state security agent -- ""he refused to identify himself"" -- at her front door preventing her from leave her home. ""Theres a lot of COVID out there, its better if you stay home,"" the unidentified man says in the video, adding a request to go upstairs to her apartment that Escobar rejects, citing a lack of warrant, legal identification, or any explanation for who this man is or why he is preventing her from leaving her home. #4deAgosto si! De nuevo han llegado a los bajos de mi edificio los enviados de la Seguridad del Estado para impedirme salir. Aqui pueden escuchar como se niega a identificarse y su expresion de ""afuera hay covid"". De nuevo todo ilegal y arbitrario. #SosCuba #InformarNoEsDelito pic.twitter.com/pNMbJUVqHS -- Luz Escobar #SOScuba (@Luz_Cuba) August 4, 2021 The status of many others remains unknown since July 11, as the government effectively disappeared them without explanation. The most prominent of these cases is that of Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), believed to be the largest dissident group on the island. No evidence suggests that Ferrer participated in the protests on July 11 or that UNPACU helped organize them, but authorities took him out of his Santiago de Cuba home that day and his family have not received any explanation or updates on his whereabouts since.

319,https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2021/08/05/watch-live-desantis-house-gop-leader-mccarthy-speak-in-south-florida/,"A visit to South Florida was aimed at pressuring the Biden administration into stronger action against the Cuban government. There were also clear political reasons for the show of force in Hialeah Gardens on Thursday. HIALEAH GARDENS, Fla. - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday that they ""will not back down"" as they push for democracy and freedom in Cuba and throughout Latin America. They spoke at a news conference in Hialeah Gardens after meeting with South Floridians from several Latin American countries earlier Thursday morning. Their message was aimed at ratcheting up pressure on President Joe Biden to proactively help the Cuban people. ""Mr. President, weve requested a meeting. Why? Because if you cant come up with ideas, we have them,"" Rep. McCarthy said. ""We can tell you the solutions. We will stand with you if you will act."" WATCH A REPLAY BELOW: Others who spoke at the news conference included Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez and U.S. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Salazar of South Florida. House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Mike McCaul (Texas) and fellow U.S. Reps. Mark Green (Tennessee) and Victoria Spartz (Indiana) also participated. Ad Earlier Thursday, the group met with members of the Cuban, Colombian, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan and Peruvian communities in South Florida to voice support for democracy in Latin America. ""DeSantis said what he has always said. Hes with the side of the Cuban people,"" said Ninoska Perez, who attended the roundtable discussion at Las Vegas Cuban Cuisine in Doral. ""He supports the Cuban-American community, and were really happy that hes the governor of Florida."" Perez was also impressed with McCarthys visit, saying: ""Its extraordinary that the leader of the Republican majority would come to Miami and see for himself what this community is all about."" It comes in the wake of widespread protests in Cuba last month that also sparked demonstrations here in South Florida. Thousands took to the streets of Cuba to protest shortages of food and medicine, restrictions on civil liberty, and the communist-run governments handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ad Gimenez, the former Miami-Dade County mayor, said he wants President Joe Biden to declare the Cuban government illegitimate because of its actions to punish protesters. Republican members of Congress are also pushing for the Biden administration to deliver internet to the island. ""If theres one message that were waiting for the Biden administration to do something about it, I have said it many times, we need two things: leadership and connectivity. Im talking about internet,"" Salazar said in an interview between the roundtable and the news conference. Asked how specifically the Biden administration help restore internet in Cuba, Salazar said: ""Well, the Biden administration can give the green light to those companies who have the technology to put up the balloons or whatever it is, satellite. Were not talking -- Im not talking about technology. Im talking about political willingness."" Ad Salazar later said that the news conference that ""patience is running out"" for what they see as Bidens half-hearted efforts to support Cuban dissidents. Biden has called Cuba a ""failed state."" He drummed up support from 20 nations for dissidents, set up a commission to study remittances, and has promised to look into restoring Cubans internet access. While the show of force by Republicans is part of an ongoing campaign to put pressure on the Biden administration, the Democrats are in fact also taking a hard line against the Cuban government. But the GOP has had a louder voice -- and more passion. ""Let the world see what is going on,"" McCarthy said. Theres also a purely political angle to this call for action in Cuba. The three Cuban-American members of Congress from South Florida are all up for re-election next year.","['Michael Putney', 'Madeleine Wright', 'David Selig']",8/5/2021 15:54,"DeSantis, House GOP Leader McCarthy pressure Biden to do more for Cuba","['south', 'desantis', 'salazar', 'florida', 'mccarthy', 'leader', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'internet', 'cuba', 'house', 'talking', 'gop', 'administration', 'pressure']","A visit to South Florida was aimed at pressuring the Biden administration into stronger action against the Cuban government.

320,https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-cuba-143c4e13cf7a840c480c860682272757,"MIAMI (AP) -- House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and fellow GOP politicians accused President Joe Biden on Thursday of not doing more to help Cubans on the island get access to the internet. Internet service was cut off at one point during a July 11 protest against the communist government, but Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. Service is still spotty across the island more than three weeks later. McCarthy met in Miami on Thursday with members of the states Cuban-American congressional delegation, Republican Gov. and aspiring presidential candidate Ron DeSantis and Republican Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez. At a news conference afterward, Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said that while specific companies had expressed a willingness to step in and help, the White House has ignored the Cuban-American delegation. Salazar said ""patience is running out."" ADVERTISEMENT Biden has said the administration is working to identify options to make the internet more accessible on the island. Internet in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. The Cuban government restricts independent news media and censors whats available online. It also disrupts internet access. Last Friday, Biden announced new sanctions against Cubas national revolutionary police and its top two officials. The president also created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to make sure the communist government is not taking a cut of the money Cubans send from the U.S. to the island. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said last month that the government was not taking any of the money. Former President Donald Trumps administration took more than 200 actions against Cuba, including limiting individual trips to the island from the U.S., barring cruise ship visits and capping remittances. The Republicans gathered in Miami said Thursday that they were against lifting the caps. U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart said increasing remittances is ""something the regime has been asking for."" Diaz-Balart added that he had participated in previous classified briefings during which several options to improve access to the internet had been presented. He said he could not release any details, but that such measures had been used in other countries. Cubans used the internet to spread word on social media about last months anti-government demonstrations. Thousands showed up in Havana and other cities to object to government policies in large protests, the likes of which had not been seen in decades. ""Remember why you want to do this,"" McCarthy said of improving and maintaining internet access for Cuban residents. ""You want individuals, those in Cuba craving freedom, to understand we are with them.""",['Adriana Gomez Licon'],8/5/2021 22:20,GOP: Biden not doing enough to help Cubans access internet,"['president', 'doing', 'access', 'biden', 'used', 'help', 'internet', 'cuban', 'republican', 'island', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'gop', 'miami', 'working']","MIAMI (AP) -- House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and fellow GOP politicians accused President Joe Biden on Thursday of not doing more to help Cubans on the island get access to the internet.

321,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/09/cuba-funeral-crisis-coffins-falling-apart-families-digging-up-relatives-to-bury-more/,"Morgues, funeral homes, and cemeteries in Cuba are failing in almost every respect to provide adequate service to families - from coffin shortages to lack of refrigeration for bodies - the Cuban independent outlet 14 y Medio reported on Sunday, due to skyrocketing numbers of deaths on the island. The Chinese coronavirus crisis has significantly worsened on the island this summer as a result of extreme government mismanagement. The Communist Party has actively promoted foreign tourism from some of nations most affected by the pandemic, including virus origin nation China and 2020 hotbed Italy, and forced citizens to spend hours on long, crowded ration lines to attain basic food goods and other home necessities. Following the July 11 national protests, the Party has also forced citizens to participate in crowded ""acts of revolutionary affirmation"" to give the world the false impression that the communist system retains popular support. Cuba has also rejected offers from the international community - including from America - to send doses of some of the worlds most effective coronavirus vaccines, opting instead for several homemade, unproven vaccine candidates. As of Friday, Havanas Public Health Ministry reported that 72 percent of recently detected cases in the city occurred in people who had received three doses of ""Abdala,"" believed to be the most advanced Cuban coronavirus vaccine candidate. The spike in coronavirus cases has sent the collapsed socialist healthcare system into a frenzy that has significantly impacted other patients, raising the death rate now that individuals with treatable conditions are not receiving the medical care they need. In Havana, central Ciego de Avila, and eastern Santiago de Cuba in particular, the situation has resulted in an overwhelming number of bodies for the government to handle. Family members report that funeral homes and cemeteries in many parts of Cuba have run out of lumber for coffins and any fabric to drape the coffins in. Typically, those building coffins in Cuba use black fabric to hide the raw wooden color, but many report running out of black-colored cloth and simply using white, a jarring contrast to tradition. Some reports in Havana indicate that all colors are running now, leaving builders to sloppily decorate coffins in multiple colors. The material used to build the coffins has also devastated family members. The outlet 14 y Medio spoke to several people who had recently lost loved ones who said the wood used for coffins was of such low quality, it appeared to be closer to cardboard and was constantly on the verge of breaking, letting the body inside fall out. ""My brother got a white coffin, something that jarred us because it was not the most common, but they told us that that was the fabric available,"" Margarita Luaces, whose brother the government listed as a Chinese coronavirus death in Ciego de Avila, told 14 y Medio. ""It also did not have any of the metal ornaments that they used to put on them [the coffins] before and when they lowered it into the grave, one of the corners opened up, it was a horrible sight."" Luaces said the coffin ""was barely carryable because it seemed like it was going to fall apart ... we were afraid the body would fall out."" Monica Estrada, who lost a sister to non-coronavirus-related disease, told the outlet that finding a coffin was only the start of problems for families of the dead. ""When you get to the cemetery its a whole other problem,"" she lamented, ""there are families ... going into family mausoleums to take out the remains of some relative who died a long time ago to make room for someone who recently died."" ""You have to take a dead person out to put another one in because theres no space,"" she added. Ciego de Avila is experiencing one of the worst shortages of burial space in the country. Reports from the area last week indicated that the government had begun to ""expand"" one of the largest local cemeteries into residents backyards without asking, resulting in piles of bodies in peoples homes flooding them with the scent of decaying remains. The government ""flooded us with bodies everywhere,"" Moraima Lugo, a local resident, told 14 y Medio. The surplus of human remains does not stop at cemeteries. Another independent outlet, Cubanet, reported on Sunday that hospitals and morgues are struggling to move bodies out to make room for more patients and keep medical areas sanitized. Cubanet published a video, reportedly taken at a hospital morgue in Manzanillo, Eastern Cuba. The video shows bodies on cots lined up in the hospitals hallways, clearly unrefrigerated and apparently unlabeled. Warning - Graphic: In Santiago de Cuba, the largest city in the east of the country, some hospitals and funeral homes report failing to efficiently dispose of the bodies because the citys hearses have broken down. Spains Diario de Cuba reported on Friday that only four of the 20 hearses the government keeps in Santiago are functioning. Some have broken-down lights, lack windshield wipers, or have had their windows broken and repaired with sheets of nylon and thus unsafe for transporting bodies. Diario de Cuba also identified another hospital, this time in Santiago, that did not have refrigeration available for bodies of the diseased. The bodies ""were piled up on cots or on the floor,"" according to a nurse who relayed the information to the outlet anonymously. The Juan Gonzalez Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba is currently filling three mass graves, one for coronavirus patients and two others for general use, according to Diario de Cuba. Videos circulating of the mass graves on social media last week, and of relatives claiming the government lost the bodies of their loved ones in the desperate attempt to bury as many people as possible, prompted accusations of ""fake news"" on the part of Cuban government propaganda outlets. The denials came with the admission, however, that the government appeared not to know where to put so many bodies. Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, admitted on Friday that the regime had taken ""organizational measures"" to transport a significant number of bodies to Juan Gonzalez Cemetery because the neighboring Santa Ifigenia Cemetery was overcrowded. ""Due to these conditions, it was decided to inter those dead of any cause (not just COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus]) in Juan Gonzalez Cemetery whose families did not have a private mausoleum or who were not cremated,"" Granma alleged, leaving open the question of exactly how the government is burying those bodies.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo HAVANA, Aug 9 (Reuters) - ""Tired of having no electricity?"" read a post in a Facebook group for residents of the small Cuban town of San Antonio de los Banos on July 10. ""Fed up of having to listen to the impudence of a government that doesn't care about you?"" ""It's time to go out and to make demands. Don't criticize at home: let's make them listen to us"". The next day, thousands took to the street in San Antonio, a town of some 50,000 people, 30 km (20 miles) southwest of Havana, kicking off a rare wave of protests throughout the Communist-run country. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Unrest has been growing across Latin America and the Caribbean as unease spreads over COVID-19 lockdowns and rising poverty. But in Cuba authorities have traditionally tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by old Cold War foe the United States. The protests, Cuba's most widespread since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, appeared largely spontaneous as Cubans vented frustrations over long lines for food, power outages, medicine shortages as well as curbs on civil freedoms. Yet an investigation by non-state Cuban outlet El Estornudo - cited by state television and confirmed by Reuters - recently showed that the first protest was convened online by a San Antonio community forum for local people and those who had emigrated. The Facebook group ""City of Humor"" - the nickname for San Antonio which hosts a biannual humor festival - was first created in 2017 as a social space, according to one of its three administrators, Miami-based Alexander Perez. Over time, people also started expressing their gripes, said Perez, 44, a pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. That prompted him and the other administrators Danilo Roque and Lazaro Gonzalez to try to ""educate them"" about their civil rights and claiming them through peaceful protest. Neither Roque nor Gonzalez, whom Perez described as two younger men who lived in San Antonio operating under the pseudonyms to avoid reprisals, responded to request for comment. The backstory shows how the recent expansion of web access in Cuba has been a gamechanger in fostering forums on social media to share criticism and to mobilize. It also shows how strengthening relations with the Cuban diaspora - thanks to the internet and greater freedom of movement - is influencing politics on the island at a grassroots level. Virtual communities like ""The City of Humor"" exist nationwide and emigres are exhorting local people on them to keep on protesting and expressing solidarity, with some even urging violence. All this poses a challenge to the government which has allowed relatively unfettered access to the internet, unlike China, which blocks many Western social media apps. Cuba has blamed the protests on online meddling by counter-revolutionaries backed by the United States, which has for decades openly sought to force reform on it through sanctions and financing for democracy programs. The administrators of the ""City of Humor"" did not receive any U.S. funding nor had they coordinated protests with other towns, Perez said. Cuba, where the state has a monopoly on telecommunications, has suffered intermittent disruptions in access to internet and social media since July 11, in an apparent bid to prevent further unrest. Protests petered out within a couple of days amid those outages, a large deployment of security forces and a wave of detentions. TEACHING CIVIL RIGHTS Posts in ""The City of Humor"" - which jumped from around 4,000 to nearly 10,000 members after the July 11 protest - show users reminiscing, selling items, promoting businesses and complaining about local issues like water supply. Perez said the administrators decided three years ago to also attempt to rally the community to demonstrate over shared gripes, with little success. Last month they felt the time was ripe to try again. The pandemic and tighter U.S. sanctions had exacerbated Cuba's economic woes, plunging it into its deepest crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union. And the COVID-19 surge was pushing its already creaking healthcare infrastructure to the brink. ""We decided this was the moment,"" said Perez. The announcement of the protest at the church park at 11 a.m. spread by word-of-mouth and messenging applications, according to three San Antonio residents who requested anonymity. But Perez said he had such low expectations that anyone would show up that he went to the beach that day. So he was stunned to get a call to say the small early turnout had snowballed. ""We certainly never imagined that San Antonio would be the spark that lit the flame causing Cuba to take to the streets three hours later,"" he said. Videos on social media showed San Antonio protesters shouting anti-government slogans like ""freedom"" and ""we are not afraid"". ""My town came out in force because it just can't take any more,"" said one resident, requesting anonymity. Within hours, President Miguel Diaz-Canel himself showed up, in a bid - he said later in a televised address to the nation - to show ""the streets belong to revolutionaries"". Some videos on social media showed him being heckled but the unrest there and elsewhere soon dwindled amid a crackdown. Perez said a heavy security presence in San Antonio meant Cubans would have to bide their time until another protest. But it was noteworthy, he said, that the government already enacted reforms like lifting customs restrictions for travelers bringing in medicine and food in response to the protests. ""If we manage to achieve this in a few hours of protest"" he wondered, ""what happens if we spend three days in the streets?""

Instead, Mr. Biden is taking an even harder line on Cuba than his predecessor, President Donald J. Trump, who tightened restrictions on travel and financial transactions. The island became an early foreign policy crisis for the Biden administration after Cubans poured into the streets to denounce their authoritarian government and the food and medicine shortages exacerbated by the pandemic. The rare act of rebellion was quashed with the biggest crackdown on dissent in a generation. The White House imposed new sanctions against Cuban officials in the past few weeks in response to the arrest of hundreds of protesters who took to the streets in cities across the island nation on July 11. Mr. Biden also asked government experts to draw up plans for the United States to unilaterally expand internet access on the island and has pledged to increase support for Cuban dissidents.","['Ernesto Londoño', 'Frances Robles']",8/9/2021 20:34,"Biden Ramps Up Pressure on Cuba, Abandoning Obama's Approach","['streets', 'states', 'president', 'white', 'ramps', 'biden', 'mr', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'island', 'cubans', 'abandoning', 'obamas', 'united', 'approach', 'pressure']","President Bidens presidency raised expectations among many Cubans of a return to the Obama days, when the United States sought to bury the last vestige of the Cold War by restoring diplomatic relations with Havana and calling for an end to the embargo.

324,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-diaspora-sends-medicines-alleviate-dire-shortages-2021-08-12/,"Summary Cuba dogged by shortages of medicines, other basic goods Cuban diaspora volunteers in Spain and elsewhere send aid Cuba especially lacking in medicines to combat COVID infections MADRID/HAVANA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Wheeling two trolleys piled high with medical supplies, Marilys Colarte waits at Madrid airport to take her precious cargo to Cuba, where vital medicines are running low. Colarte is part of a growing international network of volunteers from the Cuban diaspora who have been transporting tonnes of aid to the Caribbean island in recent months. ""Everyone has contributed a little bit of themselves, a bit of their love,"" said Colarte, 52, before boarding the plane to Havana with 100 kilograms of supplies. ""I'm so happy to bring medicine to my people who really need it."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Built under the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, Cuba's universal public healthcare system is one of his revolution's most treasured achievements but a deep economic crisis has seen shortages of medicines and other basic goods. The government largely blames U.S sanctions while its critics blame the inefficient state-run economy. Last month the shortages, along with power outages and a lack of civil liberties, prompted rare mass street protests. read more One of the measures the Cuban government took in response to the unrest was to allow travellers to bring in medicine, food and sanitary products without paying import duties. In the two weeks following that move, travellers brought in 112 tonnes of such goods via Havana international airport, Cuban customs said. read more Volunteers welcomed that move but said its impact was limited given the few flights operating to Cuba after the government restricted them due to the COVID-19 outbreak. ""The biggest diaspora community is in Florida but we went from 50 flights per week from the United States to Cuba to three,"" said Florida-based volunteer Enrique Guzman Karell. Those flights were booked up until next year, he said, meaning volunteers had to fly via Madrid, from where there were more flights - an ""absurd, very expensive trip to deliver humanitarian aid"". BATTLING COVID At a church in Madrid, boxes piled high as volunteers sorted shipments donated by hospitals, pharmacies and individuals and bound for various Cuban provinces. 1/6 Marilys Colarte queues to check in two trolleys full of medical supplies to Cuba at Adolfo Suarez Barajas airport in Madrid August 4, 2021. Picture taken August 4, 2021. REUTERS/Juan Medina Read More ""People send requests for medicine via online messenger, saying 'I've got a relative who needs this or that' and they send us the prescription,"" said Massiel Rubio Hernandez, 37, an editor and organiser of the Madrid-based Ayuda Humanitaria Cubana (Cuban Humanitarian Help), one of the first organizations to coordinate relief. Over the past three weeks, the organisation has sent a tonne of medicines and other aid that is then distributed by other volunteers. ""We mainly send antibiotics and drugs which combat COVID-19 because there is just nothing there at the moment,"" said Hilda Landrove, a Cuban student who is part of another volunteer group based in Mexico City. Cuba is currently suffering one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the world, with confirmed cases over the past week ten times the global average. read more ""The doctors have prescribed my grandmother Azithromycin but there isn't any at the state pharmacies,"" said one Havana resident who declined to be named for fear of reprisals. He said he couldn't afford current black market prices he had found online - of 1,200 pesos (about $50) per antibiotics treatment - on his monthly state salary of 3,200 pesos. ""I can't let her die because of this shortage,"" he said. Even before the COVID-19 surge, Cubans had taken to queuing outside state pharmacies from before dawn to be at the front of the line when scarce medicine supplies arrived. Some barter for medicine on social media or use herbal remedies instead as preventable diseases such as scabies spread due to a lack of adequate treatment. Volunteers like Guzman Karell are calling on Cuba to allow more flights, especially from the United States, while they say the U.S. government should once again allow flights to cities outside of Havana. ""It's a drop in the ocean, given the chronic shortages,"" said Guzman Karell, ""but at least it's something.""

325,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/one-month-after-cuba-protests-hundreds-remain-behind-bars-2021-08-12/,"Gabriela Sequeira Hernandez, 17, detained by police during a protest and waiting for her appeal after being convicted and sentenced to 8 months home arrest, holds her mother's hand during an interview in Havana, Cuba, August 10, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people, including dozens of dissident artists and opposition activists, remain detained in Communist-run Cuba a month after unprecedented anti-government protests, according to rights groups. Thousands took to the streets nationwide on July 11 to protest a dire economic crisis and curbs on civil rights. The government said the unrest was fomented by counter-revolutionaries exploiting hardship caused largely by U.S. sanctions. Rights group Cubalex has recorded around 800 detentions, a number that has risen daily as relatives come forward. Many are still too afraid to report the arrest of family members, said Cubalex director Laritza Diversent. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register While 249 people have been released, many to house arrest, most remain in ""preventative jail,"" she said. The whereabouts of 10 people is unknown. Dozens have already been sentenced to up to a year in prison or correctional work in summary trials, with simplified procedures and often without the chance of hiring a defense lawyer on time, said Diversent. ""The government's aim is to make an example of those who protested, to stop others from doing the same,"" she said. The government did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Cuban authorities have not given a figure for the total number of detained in the recent unrest but say they have so far carried out trials for 62 people, 22 of which had hired a lawyer. All but one have been deemed guilty of crimes including public disorder, resisting arrest, and vandalism, they said. The protests were largely peaceful, although state media showed some demonstrators looting and throwing stones at police. One person died and several people, including government supporters, were injured, authorities have confirmed. Several of those sentenced were not protesting, but were caught up in the unrest, according to their relatives. Yaquelin Salas, 35, says her husband intervened peacefully in the arrest of a woman, calling on police agents to not treat her so aggressively. Now he is serving a 10-month prison sentence on charges of public disorder after a collective trial in which just two of the 12 detained had lawyers. ""What they are doing is totally unfair,"" said Salas. Since Cuba's 1959 revolution, authorities have tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by the United States, which has long openly sought to force political change through sanctions and democracy initiatives. The White House has said it will do what it can to support Cuban protesters. FAMILIES 'SILENCED' Gabriela Zequeira, 17, one of several minors detained in the protests, said she was sentenced to house arrest for eight months after being arrested while walking home from the hairdressers on July 11. Upon her admission to jail, where she was kept 10 days incommunicado, she said she was required to put a finger in her vagina to show she was concealing nothing as part of a strip search. Officers kept interrupting her attempts to sleep and one officer made sexual taunts, she said in an interview. The Cuban government initially said no minors had been detained, a statement later contradicted by state prosecutors. Some relatives of those detained said authorities were pressuring them to stop speaking out. ""My family has been silenced,"" said emigre Milagros Beirut from her home in Spain. She said four of her relatives in Havana and the eastern city of Guantanamo remained behind bars for protesting peacefully. ""They've been told those detained will receive a stricter sentence if they say anything."" Dozens of political activists and dissident artists were among the detained, including some who did not participate in the protests but appeared to have been arrested pre-emptively, said Diversent from Cubalex. Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of Cuba's largest opposition group, and Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, head of a dissident artists collective, were both arrested on their way to the protests before even arriving, according to their supporters. Ferrer's sister Ana Belkis Ferrer said the family had not been able to speak to or see him, a complaint of many relatives of those detained. ""We don't know if he's being beaten, if he's well or not, whether or not he's doing a hunger strike,"" she said. Another detained activist, Felix Navarro, 68, president of the Party for Democracy, was in hospital with COVID-19, said Diversent. Several of those detained have denounced unsanitary conditions in jail amid one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the world.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini WASHINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Friday it was imposing sanctions on two Cuban Ministry of Interior officials and a military unit over the government's crackdown on protesters last month. The department said it was sanctioning Romarico Vidal Sotomayor Garcia and Pedro Orlando Martinez Fernandez and the Tropas de Prevencion (TDP) of the Cuban Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces. ""Todays action shines a spotlight on additional perpetrators responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights,"" said Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said TDP soldiers had been deployed ""and have reportedly attacked and beaten protesters, while making violent arrests."" ""The United States supports the people of Cuba in their brave call for freedom as we identify those who oppress them and attempt to maintain a repressive system,"" he said in a statement. ""We will continue to take actions to promote accountability for the Cuban governments human rights abuses."" Cubas Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Twitter rejected the sanctions, calling them ""U.S. opportunistic measures against Cuba's Ministry of Interior officers and Armed Forces Prevention Troops. Such measures reflect double standards of a government used to manipulation and lies to maintain the blockade against #Cuba."" In July, the United States put sanctions on the Cuban police force and two of its leaders. The protests erupted amid Communist-ruled Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of its old ally, the Soviet Union, and a record surge in coronavirus infections. Thousands took to the streets, angry over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, which in recent years has tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island. He has said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns. The U.S. Treasury earlier announced sanctions on Cuba's defense minister and an interior ministry special forces unit over allegations of human rights abuses in the crackdown that followed the protests, in which hundreds of activists were detained.

A decree signed by Communications Minister Mayra Arevich was meant to ""prevent, detect and respond opportunely to possible enemy, criminal and harmful activities that could occur in cyberspace."" It forbids spreading content that attacks ""the constitutional, social and economic"" rules of the state or that incite demonstrations or other acts ""that alter public order."" It also targets messages that justify violence or that affect peoples privacy or dignity. The decree also bans ""cyberterrorism"" aimed at subverting order or destabilizing the country, categorizing it as a crime of ""very high"" danger. ADVERTISEMENT It did not specify penalties, which are to be set in legislation later. But if offered a model form that people can fill out to denounce ""cybersecurity incidents."" Thousands of Cubans took part in protests on July 11 and 12, angered by shortages of food and medicine and by power outages, as well as some demanding more political freedom. The government accused outside groups and the U.S. government of using social media to cause trouble, and arrested numerous people -- officials have not given numbers -- as well as limiting access to the internet and temporarily cutting off access to cellphone data plans. While the new decree specifically deals with actions on the internet, Cuba already has laws that punish people for actions and statements that undermine its socialist system. The gazette also published rule against providing telecommunications services without official authorization, setting fines ranging from the equivalent of $800 to $1,600. In the past, the government often has cracked down on people who used clandestine satellite television dishes and decoders to pick up TV signals from the United States. In the wake of the protests, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said it is studying ways to give Cubans independent access to the internet. Republican critics have criticized Biden for not acting more quickly.",['Andrea Rodríguez'],8/17/2021 21:13,"Following protests, Cuba lays out laws on social media use","['decree', 'media', 'state', 'lays', 'access', 'internet', 'protests', 'cuba', 'using', 'social', 'following', 'laws']","Following protests, Cuba lays out laws on social media useHAVANA (AP) -- Cubas government on Tuesday spelled out its laws against using social media or the internet to stir up protests or insult the state -- and offered people a form to report offenders.

328,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rare-doctors-outcry-highlights-cubas-covid-crisis-growing-dissent-2021-08-18/,"A horse cart passes a flag displayed for the arrival of the Cuban medical brigade of the Henry Reeve Contingent from Andorra amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Havana, Cuba, July 1, 2020. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Several doctors in Cuba have taken to social media to decry shortages of medicine, oxygen and other materials needed to battle a dire COVID-19 outbreak, in a rare public denunciation of conditions in the island's hallowed healthcare system. The outcry comes in reaction to comments by government officials that the doctors say scapegoat medics for the country's worsening plight while downplaying precarious conditions pre-dating the current crisis. ""I want to denounce the collapse of our health system in our hospital as well as in the rest of the country, due to a lack of resources and protective gear,"" said Dr. Francisco Pavon in a video shared on social media, featuring more than 20 doctors and medical students in the eastern province of Holguin. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Others took to Facebook or messaging platforms to denounce the critical situation and demand more support from authorities. Similar criticism has been seen elsewhere globally during the pandemic as medical staff have reached a breaking point when infections have ballooned, overwhelming even the richest of healthcare systems. But in Cuba it is unusual, as authorities often restrict public dissent, saying unity is necessary to combat open U.S. attempts to force political change. And the topic is especially sensitive: healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of Cuba's ""revolutionary"" one-party system, having produced results on a par with rich nations. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged last week the healthcare system was overwhelmed. Cuba currently has one of the highest caseloads worldwide. The government has blamed tougher U.S. sanctions for worsening shortages on the island and slowing the roll-out of home-grown vaccines. But doctors' complaints have exposed simmering resentment over how rundown Cuba's healthcare system was even before the pandemic, with many blaming economic mismanagement not U.S. sanctions, as well as low salaries and other labor issues. Coming a month after unprecedented nationwide anti-government protests, rights activists say it is another sign Cubans are losing their fear of speaking up despite the risk of reprisals, like losing their job or being expelled from university. The growth of internet access in Cuba, providing virtual forums to share gripes and mobilize, has been key, they say. Diaz-Canel blamed last month's protests on the United States, accusing Washington of fomenting dissent online. But he also signaled he was open to reforms and a re-evaluation of Cuba's economic policies. 'SHAME ON YOU' While state-run media have published few details of Cuba's COVID-19 crisis, reports of incinerators breaking down due to excess corpses or deaths due to a lack of oxygen have been emerging in provincial outlets in the worst-affected provinces and on social media. But Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said he had heard more complaints during a visit to the central province of Cienfuegos about ""mistreatment and neglect"" by doctors than about scarcity. That, and statements by other officials alluding to doctors not showing up at their clinics or taking holidays in the middle of the crisis, proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back for many overworked doctors. ""Shame on you for criticizing those on the front lines,"" wrote Marian Vasquez, 23, a doctor and trainee-surgeon at the main Cienfuegos hospital, on Facebook. ""It's time you did more and criticized and lied less."" The country has long prided itself on having one of the highest ratios of physicians per capita, but many are deployed overseas. Now, the country is bringing hundreds back. ""Why the closed door meetings. Why did you not meet and dialogue with those on the ground?"" asked Miguel Angel Gonzalez, a doctor in Cienfuegos, chiming in with growing accusations among Cubans that government officials are out of touch with the people. He said the medics had hoped officials might be able to explain how they were supposed to work without enough equipment to do chest x-rays for all the patients in intensive therapy or the reactives to conduct basic tests. Government officials this week moved into damage control mode, underscoring their gratitude for the work of doctors and their efforts to increase oxygen supplies. ""What we have most proven in this time is the patriotism of our people, the healthcare staff, scientists. Working full time in complicated situations,"" wrote the president on Twitter. ""Thanks to all!"" Wearing a white doctor's coat, stethoscope around his neck and face mask, one doctor in the video, Rafael Alejandro Fuentes, said he was afraid, not of the pandemic, but of how government would interpret them ""demanding (their) rights."" State media said on Tuesday Cuba was updating its telecoms legislation to outlaw certain behavior on social media like publishing ""false news, offensive messages or defamation with impact on the country's prestige."" Cuba says it has the right to defend itself against U.S.-backed counterrevolutionaries seeking to overthrow it. However, some doctors saw this as an attempt to muzzle them and other critics. Access to internet and social media was also heavily disrupted in the weeks following the July 11 protests. ""We could not speak in public spaces,"" said one doctor working at a COVID-19 isolation center, on condition of anonymity. ""Now we can't do it over the internet.""

329,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/new-cuban-decree-tightens-controls-social-media-sparking-outrage-2021-08-18/,"HAVANA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Cuba introduced tighter controls on the use of social media this week, including a ban on publications that might damage ""the country's prestige,"" angering many citizens and international rights activists. Decree 35, published in the official gazette on Tuesday, comes a month after the most widespread anti-government protests in the Communist-run country in decades, which spread in part due to information shared on social media. The legislation bans the spread of false news or messages and content deemed offensive or which ""incite mobilizations or other acts that upset public order."" It also provides a channel for Cubans to inform on potential contraventions. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Those who have attempted to ""subvert the constitutional order"" will be considered cyberterrorists. It does not say what the penalties will be for violations. ""Our Decree 35 goes against misinformation and cyber lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who has blamed the July 11 protests on an online campaign by U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. Cuba analysts compared the measure to the totalitarianism of George Orwell's ""1984"", saying that they feared the vague definitions of what constitutes a violation would allow for arbitrary implementation. Since the introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago, platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp have enabled Cubans to share their gripes and even mobilize in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. ""Cuba is formalizing digital repression,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty's Americas director, noting the state already had monopoly over internet access, which was curtailed during and following the July 11 protests. Nicaragua passed similar ""cyber crime"" legislation last year and has used it to muzzle opposition, she said. Cuba's new decree explicitly orders the state telecoms monopoly to suspend services to users who have committed contraventions, in coordination with relevant authorities. 1/4 People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Read More 'WE CAN'T EVEN TALK' Cuban officials have long argued that dialogue is permitted but only ""within the revolution,"" to present a unified front against the United States, which has long openly sought to force political change in the country. Last month, the U.S. government said it was working with the private sector and Congress to look for ways to make the internet more accessible to the people of Cuba. Some Cuban Americans have used social media to encourage Cubans on the island to rise up against the government, with a few even urging then to commit acts of sabotage. But many young Cubans say that should not be an excuse for them to be banned from expressing themselves and have taken to social media to criticize the new measure, enacted a month after protests that resounded with cries of ""freedom."" ""Now we can't even talk,"" said one doctor, on condition of anonymity, who had participated in a video denouncing dire working conditions amid Cuba's COVID-19 crisis. The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday Cuba should ""not punish those who speak the truth"" while the British ambassador to Havana, Antony Stokes, wrote on Twitter that the recent crackdown on protesters and the censorship embodied by Decree 35 would ""silence legitimate voices."" Canada-based Cuban legal analyst Eloy Viera said Decree 35 outlined regulations rather than updated the penal code, so would not result in jailtime for those found transgressing. But it was a more severe and explicitly political measure to regulate online expression than a previous, 2019 decree that bans the ""spreading of information contrary to the common good, morals, decency, and integrity,"" he said. Government critics have faced fines under that decree, said Viera. But ultimately it had not been effective and neither, likely, would Decree 35, he said. ""They won't be able to apply it to all the discontent of Cubans, who have found in social media a space that does not exist in the country's public places,"" said Viera.
