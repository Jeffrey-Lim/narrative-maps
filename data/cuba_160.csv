Picture released by Cuban News Agency (ACN) of Cuban First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro speaking during the opening session of the 8th Congress of the Cuban Communist Party at the Convention Palace in Havana, on April 16, 2021. (AFP) Raul Castro has confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the all-powerful Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel. In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said on Friday the new leadership were party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit."" Castro had said at the last party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the ""historic generation"" who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a US-backed dictator in a 1959 leftist revolution. He already handed over the presidency to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, in 2018. The Congress is the party's most important meeting, held every five years to review policy and fix leadership. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention centre in Havana. The congress is a closed-door event but excerpts are being broadcast on state television. Castro hailed Diaz-Canel as one of the new generation of leaders, praising the ""good results"" he had achieved in his three years in office. Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege who is widely expected to succeed him as party first secretary, the most powerful position in Cuba's one-party system.

A tightening of the decades-old US trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in the ailing centrally planned economy, which was already struggling following a decline in Venezuelan aid. That has led to shortages of even basic goods, with many Cubans spending hours lining up to buy groceries.

US President Joe Biden, who took office in January, has vowed to roll back some of Trump's sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities. Castro said Cuba was ready for a new relationship. ""I ratify from this party congress the will to develop a respectful dialogue and edify a new type of relationship with the United States without, in order to achieve it, Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism,"" he said.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Discontent has been fuelled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.

In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the islands dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise, a category long banned or tightly restricted, permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes. This years congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities. The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society. Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism. He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution. Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016. Small changes The PCC has said its congress, held 60 years after Fidel Castro officially declared Cuba's government a socialist one, would ""review core issues of the political, economic and social life of the country."" There are some signs that Cuba's leadership will have little choice but to increasingly balance the interests of the old guard with a clamor for more rights and better quality of life from younger generations. In February, it opened the bulk of its government-monopolised economy to entrepreneurs in the private sector. There have also been small nods to social liberalisation. In recent months, the government held its first-ever talks, though short-lived, with pro-free speech protesters, after authorising in 2019 Cuba's first non-political demonstration, by animal rights activists. 'Subversion' The arrival of the internet on mobile phones at the end of 2018 has made for a paradigm shift in Cuba, with never-before-seen access to information and new forums for expression and even limited protest. In response, the PCC has said one of the functions of its congress would be ""confronting political and ideological subversion, which has made the internet and social media its principal field of operations."" Castro told the congress he was retiring as ""a simple revolutionary fighter. ""Let there be no doubt, as long as I live, I will be ready... to defend the homeland, revolution and socialism,"" he said to loud applause.

Llerena, a New Jersey contractor, escaped the Communist island as part of a mass migration of Cubans known as the Mariel boat lift in 1980, when Rauls brother Fidel Castro was at the helm. ""Were happy. Weve been waiting for it,"" said Llerena, 61, who was playing rummy with friends at the Jose Marti Park in Union City. The park features a bronze bust of the 19th century Cuban poet and patriot, who lived in exile in New York from 1880 until he returned to fight against Spanish imperialism in Cuba, where he died in 1895. Like Marti, Llerena originally moved to New York City from Havana. Llerena has lived in New Jersey since 1982, he said. Dubbed Havana on the Hudson, Union City and West New York have been home to a small Cuban community since the 1940s. Raul Castro gives a speech in 2019. Yamil Lage/Pool via Reuters Although Raul Castro, 89, stepped down from his leadership of the islands ruling Communist Party, little will change on the island, Llerena said. ""Every single one whos got to do with the communist party has got to go,"" said Llerena. ""All the remaining people alive, they have to pay for all the crimes of the past 61 years.""

In 2008, Raul Castro took over Cubas leadership from his older brother Fidel Castro, the revolutionary leader who had ruled the island since toppling the regime of Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Fidel Castro died in 2016. Although Diaz-Canel is part of a younger generation of politicians on the island, he is serving at the behest of Raul Castro and is unlikely to make sweeping changes on the island, other Cuban American critics told The Post. Raul Castro announced his resignation on April 16, 2021. Ariel Ley/ACN/AFP via Getty Images ""They talk a good talk but I dont see any difference,"" said Tony, 52, a first-generation Cuban American who runs La Pola, his familys Cuban restaurant in West New York. In 2018, a Food Network critic called the restaurants Cuban sandwich the best in the US, sparking a feud with other Cuban communities in Florida. ""Its just one for passing the torch to another,"" said Tony about the handover of power on the island. Diaz-Canel will likely be elected as the secretary general of the Communist Party during this weekends party congress. Both the presidency and head of the party have been traditionally held by the same leader in the country.","['Ben Brachfeld', 'Yamil Lage Afp Via Getty Images', 'Carlos Garcia Rawlins Reuters', 'Social Links For Ben Brachfeld', 'Social Links For Isabel Vincent', 'Contact The Author']",4/17/2021 22:05,Cuban Americans 'happy' to see end of Castro dynasty,"['party', 'end', 'americans', 'llerena', 'leader', 'communist', 'cuban', 'castro', 'dynasty', 'raul', 'island', 'fidel', 'york', 'happy']","When Raul Castro announced the end of his family dynastys grip on power in Cuba, Horacio Llerena was happy to see him go.

3,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-dissidents-decry-harassment-congress-denounces-counterrevolution-attempts-2021-04-18/,"A picture of former Cuban President Raul Castro is displayed in the window of a state building in Havana, Cuba, April 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, April 18 (Reuters) - Cuban dissidents accused authorities of cutting their web access and preventing them from leaving their homes during the Cuban Communist Party Congress where leaders denounced renewed U.S.-backed attempts at ""counterrevolution"" using online platforms. The four-day congress, where Raul Castro is set to step down as Communist Party leader, takes place amid a dire economic crisis that has fueled social discontent. U.S. sanctions and the pandemic have exacerbated the woes of the ailing state-run economy. The rollout of the internet has also provided new platforms for Cubans to express their frustrations in a one party system which tightly controls public spaces and boosted the growth of non-state media challenging a state monopoly of mass media. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register loading During a speech opening the congress on Friday, Castro warned the ""counterrevolution"" lacked popular support or leadership but was adept at manipulating the web. ""We are firmly convinced the streets, parks and squares belong to the revolutionaries and we will never deny our heroic people the right to defend its revolution,"" said Castro. The U.S. State Department has declined to directly address a Reuters' question about Havana's view that Washington and U.S. groups finance dissidents in a bid to destabilize it. ""We support those in civil society, in Cuba and around the world, who are defending their rights or struggling for freedom,"" a State Department spokesperson said earlier this month. So-called ""acts of repudiation"" when mobs of pro-government supporters show up to harass dissidents have made a comeback in Havana lately after years in which they were not deployed. Castro said counterrevolutionary groups were seeking to infiltrate and manipulate specific groups like the artistic or religious sectors in a bid to break national unity. The party passed a resolution on Sunday agreeing to strengthen ""revolutionary activism"" in social networks. Many of those who have denounced state harassment during the congress belong to the dissident artist collective the San Isidro Movement and 27N, a group of artists, thinkers and journalists which arose from a rare protest of several hundred people outside the culture ministry on Nov. 27. Both call for greater civil liberties and are the fresh face of the Cuban opposition in a country which is proud of its rich arts scene and where traditional political opposition groups have struggled to gain ground. ""State security rang us up to say they would not let anyone leave their homes during the congress, not even to put out the rubbish,"" 27N member and globally renowned performance artist Tania Bruguera told Reuters by telephone. ""They also cut internet for some of us."" Cuban authorities do not comment on police activity such as the detention of dissidents. Bruguera said she and other members of ""27N"" had been on and off prevented from leaving their homes and subjected to brief detentions and interrogations ever since the group's formation. State television has done programs on many attacking them. ""That Raul is retiring does not mean there will be change,"" said Bruguera who six years ago created an Institute of Artivisim in Havana, of the congress, which the party dubbed the ""congress of continuity"". ""Castro goes but Castrism stays"" read an editorial in the non-state online media outlet 14ymedio. The San Isidro Movement said one of their most prominent members Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara was detained overnight on Friday and his artworks seized from his home. He had been staging a performance in which he planned to sit in a garrote during the congress to denounce repression. Fellow MSI member and poet Amaury Pacheco told Reuters by phone he was also briefly detained when he tried to leave his house in protest at the seizure of Otero Alcantara's works. ""They don't want any raised voice or embarrassment during these four days,"" said Pacheco.

The four-day congress, where Raul Castro is set to step down as Communist Party leader, takes place amid a dire economic crisis that has fueled social discontent.

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) HAVANA (AP) -- If you dont have potato, use malanga root. If you cant find zucchini, replace it with cucumber. Cant find the ingredients you want? No problem: Yuliet Colon will help you whip up a dessert using the eggs you ran across, swap pork for the ground chicken in that recipe, even peanuts for beans in your Cuban-style rice. Shes among a number of Cubans who, with more ingenuity than resources, help their compatriots cope with shortages exacerbated by the new coronavirus pandemic with Facebook posts of culinary creations designed around what theyre actually likely to find at the market or with government rations. ADVERTISEMENT ""I love Master Chef Spain, but where do I get liquid nitrogen in this country?"" joked Colon, a 39-year-old mother of two and one of the creators of the Facebook page, ""Recipes from the Heart."" The site, launched in June, how has more than 12,000 members -- many of them on an island just becoming accustomed to social media due to recently improved internet access. The combination of COVID-19, which shut off income from tourism on the island, local economic productivity woes and sharpened U.S. sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump has led to increased scarcities in Cuba, where gross domestic product decreased by 11% in 2020. Long queues became noticeable last year, and 2021 opened with government economic reforms that effectively raised both prices and pay -- though not always at the same rate. Colon last week visited an agricultural market near her house and, after standing in lines for about 40 minutes, bought the few vegetables she found. She used them to create something that she called ""Cuban-style pisto manchego"" which includes onion, peppers, tomato, eggplant and cucumber -- winning admiring comments from other group members. These days, Cuban household staples come and go without warning. When toothpaste appears, deodorant disappears, and when it returns, soap and the toilet paper have vanished. The same is true for rice, beans, milk, cheese, onions, tomato and or garlic. Fruit has not been seen for weeks. Sometimes potato disappears, prompting Cubans to turn to other tubers popular in the region, yuca or rough-skinned malanga. The Facebook site has become a home for proposals on how to chicken when its the only meat available or create artisanal cheeses with others arent available. ""There are a lot of shortages"", lamented Colon in the small kitchen of her house while she prepared her ""pisto manchego,"" chopping the vegetables and photographing the process before uploading the images. ADVERTISEMENT She added a bit of fresh basil and oregano she took from a small flowerbed that a relative grows at the side of her house. ""What I like the most is making desserts, but now its hard to get eggs, milk or flour,"" Colon said. The Facebook page is an internet-era democratization of earlier efforts to help Cubans make due in hard times, notably following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which devastated the economy of its Caribbean ally in the early 1990s. A TV cooking show at that time once offered suggestions for cooking grapefruit rind steaks. Thanks to arrival of internet access, services to manage food or deliver merchandise have proliferated and relatives abroad can even directly pay telephone bills for those on the island. Cubans can share tips on WhatsApp or Twitter about which stores are stocked with which products. Theyve also helped make authorities more accountable in some cases -- as when a state factory distributed croquettes that cooks complained seemed to explode when put in oil and authorities responded with explanations in the local press. Colon relies on the internet to communicate with her mother, whose deposits help pay for web access that keeps her on Facebook. Colon usually adds a few family anecdotes in her posts.

After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Sanchez ended up in a detention center facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) MIAMI (AP) -- After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba. Since the end of the Obama administration, the number of Cubans deported from the U.S. has increased more than tenfold to more than 800 in the past year as the Trump administration enforces a new policy inked just days before it took over. It is also imposing its own sharp limits on who is eligible for asylum. Thats an unwelcome development for growing numbers of asylum-seeking Cubans who had long benefited from a generous U.S. approach and their governments unwillingness to take its people back. ADVERTISEMENT For decades, Cubans fleeing the communist-governed island had for the most part enjoyed unique privileges. Even after the cold war ended, they were given a certain path to legal residence once they touched U.S. soil through the policy known as ""wet foot, dry foot."" But an agreement reached during the final days of the Obama administration ended that and required Cuba to take back citizens who receive deportation orders going forward and consider on a case-by-case basis the return of the thousands of other Cubans who had received such orders over the decades but remained in the U.S. because their country wouldnt take them back. Since Trump took office, more Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border have encountered new limits, including a policy introduced last month that denies protection to asylum seekers who have passed through another country before reaching Mexico and have not sought asylum there. Despite the new agreement, Cuba remains reluctant to take its people back, and is one of 10 countries that the U.S. government labels ""recalcitrant."" That makes it difficult for the administration to enforce its aggressive measures against asylum -- and leaves many Cubans in limbo. Many, like Sanchez, are baffled by their predicament. Sanchez is married to Barbara Rodriguez, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Miami, but was unable to apply for a visa in Cuba to join his wife in the U.S. because the Trump administration pulled most of its embassy staff out, outsourcing family-related visa petitions to consular services in Colombia or Guyana. Rodriguez claims Sanchez was facing increasing political persecution after having brushes with local authorities over such episodes as damaging a referendum ballot as a sign of protest. ADVERTISEMENT The couple agreed he had to get out of Cuba, saying they had learned he was being investigated and could face jail time. Feeling they had no time to waste -- and with no visa services available in Cuba -- Sanchez traveled to Nicaragua and through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S., at a port of entry where authorities detained him and later sent him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for long-term custody. ""This is plain cruel, despite arriving in this country and demonstrating that you are persecuted and that you have credible fear. After all, this gets thrown away,"" said his wife, Rodriguez, who talks to Sanchez on the phone daily. ""The worse thing is that now I feel all that is left for him is deportation."" It is unclear how the Cuban government treats people who are deported from the U.S., but rights advocates and lawyers say they could face retaliation for claiming asylum, especially those who claimed they were being persecuted. By contrast, deportees to Mexico and Central American countries typically get a warm welcome home. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla told The Associated Press the increase in deportations stems from the country ""diligently fulfilling its commitments"" outlined in the accord with the Obama administration, but at the same time he blasted the U.S. for cutting consular services in Havana. ""It is a shame to politicize the human bond between people and between nations,"" he said. A chartered U.S. government flight landed in Havana on Sept. 27 with 96 Cubans aboard, and another with 120 arrived Aug. 30. U.S. officials say Cubas acceptance of this limited number of deportees is a small step, but they believe the nation is still largely unwilling to work with the U.S. on repatriations. They note 39,243 Cubans living in the U.S. with deportation orders. ""Cuba is kind of a thorn in their side in this area,"" said Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Cuba remains on a U.S. government list of ""recalcitrant"" nations with nine other countries: China, Vietnam, Iran, Bhutan, Cambodia, Eritrea, Hong Kong, Laos and Pakistan. About 21,000 Cubans have presented themselves to officials at U.S.-Mexico crossings since last October, triple the number seen the previous 12 months, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics. Thousands more Cubans have been stranded in northern Mexico cities on wait lists to request asylum and through a program that forces migrants to wait south of the border for their asylum cases to play out. Of the Cubans who have been allowed into the U.S., many have been released from custody while they await court dates for their asylum cases, but hundreds have been turned over to ICE custody. About 5,000 Cubans have received deportation orders since the new U.S.-Cuba agreement, and 1,300 of them have been deported, according to ICE data. Luis Dayan Palmero left Cuba in April, traveling from Guyana to Brazil and Colombia, before passing through Central America and arriving in northern Mexico in August. He crossed the Rio Grande and surrendered to Border Patrol agents, who sent him to Matamoros, Mexico. He now has a U.S. court appearing set this month. ""I plan to ask for asylum, and whatever happens is what God wants,"" Palmero said. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein contributed to this story from Havana.","['Adriana Gomez Licon', 'Gisela Salomon']",4/21/2021 6:08,Trump administration ramps up deportations to Cuba,"['mexico', 'asylum', 'deportations', 'ramps', 'cuba', 'deportation', 'cubans', 'rodriguez', 'sanchez', 'trump', 'administration', 'border']","(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)MIAMI (AP) -- After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba.

(U.S. State Department via AP) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Wednesday accused the top U.S. diplomat in the country of working closely with Jose Daniel Ferrer, the detained head of one of the countrys largest opposition groups. The accusations against charge daffaires Mara Tekach were a break from Cubas normal language on U.S. relations, which had remained measured despite an escalating Trump administration campaign to cut off revenue and oil to Cuba. Tekach and the U.S. Embassy in Cuba have tried to foment division among Cubans, ""identifying areas of the economy where they can direct coercive measures, and trying to slander and discredit the performance of the Cuban government and Cuban revolution,"" a Cuban government statement said. The U.S. Embassy in Cuba reopened in 2015 during President Barack Obamas normalization of relations with the island. It has been operating with a skeleton staff since the withdrawal of most personnel in 2017 due to concerns about mysterious health symptoms whose cause has still not been publicly determined. ADVERTISEMENT Ferrer was detained last month on charges that remained unclear until this week. The U.S., opposition groups and human rights organizations demanded his release. Ferrers supporters said that he had been charged with assault and called the case a fabrication. The statement Wednesday in Granma, the Communist Partys official newspaper, said Ferrer was detained Oct. 1 with three other people on suspicion of kidnapping and assaulting another man. It alleged that, since the detention, the United States has used the case in a campaign to discredit Cuba. ""The United States Embassy in Cuba has been the fundamental vehicle for attending to, orienting and financing the conduct of Jose Daniel Ferrer, in a clear demonstration of interference in Cubas internal affairs and open instigation of violence,"" the Cuban statement said. The U.S. says Ferrer is a peaceful dissident whose human rights have been regularly violated by Cuban security forces. Ferrers Patriotic Union of Cuba is perhaps the countrys largest opposition group, with operations based mainly in the east of the island. It sporadically organizes protests against the government, which calls its members mercenaries backed by the U.S. and Cuban exiles overseas.",['Michael Weissenstein'],4/21/2021 12:42,Cuba accuses US diplomat of supporting illegal actions,"['largest', 'diplomat', 'nov', 'ferrer', 'opposition', 'embassy', 'tekach', 'cuban', 'accuses', 'supporting', 'cuba', 'detained', 'statement', 'illegal', 'actions']","1 of 2 This undated photo downloaded from the U.S. Embassy in Cuba website shows Mara Tekach, charge d'affaires for the U.S. Embassy in Cuba.

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) FILE - In this March 21, 2016 file photo, Cuban President Raul Castro, right, lifts up the arm of President Barack Obama at the conclusion of their joint news conference at the Palace of the Revolution, in Havana, Cuba. The current Trump U.S. administration is close to announcing a new policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama, according to a Trump administration official and a person involved in the ongoing policy review. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) HAVANA (AP) -- President Barack Obamas 2014 opening with Cuba helped funnel American travel dollars into military-linked tourism conglomerates even as state security agents waged a fierce crackdown on dissent. The rapprochement also poured hundreds of millions in U.S. spending into privately owned businesses on the island, supercharging the growth of an entrepreneurial middle-class independent of the communist state. It opened a new market for American corporations, with JetBlue and American Airlines operating from gleaming new Havana offices and tens of thousands of private bed-and-breakfasts listed on Airbnb. ADVERTISEMENT Internet access became an affordable reality for hundreds of thousands of Cubans as President Raul Castro met a pledge to Obama and opened nearly 400 public Wi-Fi access points across the country. Meanwhile, longtime enemies separated by 90 miles of ocean struck agreements to cooperate on issues ranging from human trafficking to oil spills. This is the complex scenario facing President Donald Trump as Cuban-American legislators and lobbyists pressure him to fulfill his campaign promise to undo Obamas deal with Cuba. The administration is close to announcing a new policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama, according to a Trump administration official and a person involved in the ongoing policy review. ""As the President has said, the current Cuba policy is a bad deal. It does not do enough to support human rights in Cuba,"" White House spokesman Michael Short said. ""We anticipate an announcement in the coming weeks."" Still under debate: new restrictions on American leisure travel to Cuba, which has more than tripled since Obamas announcement, to nearly 300,000 last year. Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans hate the idea of U.S. travelers enjoying mojitos in the police state that drove exiles from their homes and businesses. Tourism to Cuba remains barred by U.S. law, and American travelers to Cuba still must fall into one of 12 categories of justification for their travel, ranging from religious to educational activities meant to bring the traveler into contact with Cuban people. When Obama took office, ""people-to-people"" travelers could only see the country as part of organized tours -- a measure meant to guarantee that Americans experienced only educational activities such as visits to printing workshops or organic farmers markets. ADVERTISEMENT In reality, the tour requirement guaranteed that American travelers spent virtually every second of their time in Cuba under the direct control of the government, which requires U.S. tour operators to use government tour buses and guides and stay almost entirely in state-run hotels. As his second term came to a close, Obama eliminated that requirement and opened the door for tens of thousands of travelers to book their own independent trips to Cuba. Opponents of Obamas rollback say that has allowed many to engage in prohibited tourism, spending leisure days at the beach and all-inclusive resorts. But individual travel has also served as rocket fuel for Cubas burgeoning private sector. Tens of thousands of Americans are booking direct flights on U.S. airlines to Havana, reserving private lodging through Airbnb and spending thousands of dollars on private guides, taxis and restaurants. A former industrial engineer, 31-year-old Adyarin Ruiz runs a four-bedroom bed-and-breakfast in a restored section of Old Havana thats seeing an increasing number of Americans willing to pay up to $100 a night in a country where state salaries average $25 a month. ""Over the last two years, since relations with the U.S. were restored, Ive seen the growth in American tourism, and even more so since the direct flights started,"" Ruiz said. ""The Americans whove come here are VIPS. You can see that they have money and they appreciate and demand quality, and demand that the house looks really pretty."" There are also now U.S. jobs dependent on travel to Cuba. The American pro-detente group Engage Cuba released a study Thursday asserting that a complete rollback of Obamas Cuba policy would cost airlines and cruise lines $3.5 billion over the next four years and lead to the loss of 10,154 travel jobs. Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss ongoing policy talks say domestic political concerns are the main force driving any rollback on Cuba. During the transition, Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson privately expressed support for Obamas Cuba policy, U.S. officials from the former and current administrations told The Associated Press. The main people still seeking a reversal in the opening are Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, both Cuban-Americans. The Trump government wants to maintain good relations with both Rubio, who sits on the Senate committee investigating Trumps relations with Russia, and Diaz-Balart, a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. Some top Trump advisers also believe that a 2020 re-election victory will rest on keeping the loyalty of Cuban-Americans in Florida whom they see as essential to winning the critical swing state. Many object to the Cuban government seeing any benefit from relations with the U.S., opposed to thousands of American travelers staying in hotels run by GAESA, an increasingly powerful business conglomerate with deep military ties. Cuban-Americans have been particularly offended by Obama allowing U.S. companies to deal directly with military-linked companies, most prominently in an agreement for Stamford, Connecticut-based Starwood to manage at least two Havana hotels. Anti-Castro forces have also been demanding action on human rights: arrests and short-term detentions of protesters climbed from 8,899 in 2014 to 9,940 last year. Cuban officials say many of those arrests are deliberately provoked by dissidents who are funded and backed by anti-Castro groups with the deliberate objective of driving up detention statistics. But the officials say theres another reason to tighten Americas Cuba policy: pressuring Venezuela. The Trump administration has been looking for ways to force Venezuela to address the near-daily protests and violence trying to shake President Nicolas Maduros iron grip on power. Cuba is Maduros close ally and supporter and measures against the Cuban military would send at least the appearance that the U.S. is taking action. Meanwhile, Cuba is preparing for its own transition. Castro is planning to leave Cubas presidency in February 2018 and is expected to hand the role to a 57-year-old vice president who has said little about his vision for the country. Rubios office described the senators goals as laying the groundwork for a new generation of Cuban leaders to empower ordinary citizens of the island. ""I am confident the President will keep his commitment on Cuba policy by making changes that are targeted and strategic and which advance the Cuban peoples aspirations for economic and political liberty,"" Rubio said in a statement released by his office Thursday. _________ Weissenstein reported from Havana and Miami.

8,https://apnews.com/33d21df8f7de4d34b3fd0b26659b9ea8/'Tear-down-this-firewall'---US-looks-to-expand-Cuba-internet,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new U.S. task force ordered by President Donald Trump warned Wednesday that Cubas government uses internet restrictions to stifle dissent and vowed to find ways the United States could expand access and freedom for Cubans online. The Cuba Internet Task Force held its first public meeting over the objections of Cuban President Raul Castros government, which has dismissed it as an exercise in attempted subversion by Washington. The task force forms part of Trumps tougher approach to Cuba and partial rollback of former President Barack Obamas diplomatic opening with the island. ADVERTISEMENT ""Mr. Castro, tear down this firewall,"" declared Andre Mendes, acting director of the Broadcasting Board of Governors Office of Cuba Broadcasting, in a high-tech twist on former President Ronald Reagans famed admonition to former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Although the task forces narrow mandate is to develop recommendations for how the U.S. could expand internet access in Cuba, the meeting quickly took on clear political undertones, ever-present in Americas long and emotional debate about its policy toward the communist-run island 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Florida. Under fluorescent lighting in a sparse, basement conference room at the State Department, several Cuban dissidents used a public comment period to lambast Cubas government, drawing comparisons to World War II and to the governments of Syria and Iran. Yet most of the public comments centered on a critique of a decades-old economic embargo and Trumps policy toward Cuba. Some argued that any U.S. efforts would backfire, by undermining the perceived independence and credibility of burgeoning independent media in Cuba. Created under a directive from Trump last June, the task force includes senior officials from the State Department, the Commerce Department, the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Agency for International Development. It has no budget, but set a goal to deliver its report on recommendations to Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by February 2019. John Creamer, the deputy assistant secretary of state, said estimates show internet penetration in Cuba is between 5 percent and 40 percent, with the higher figure including those who only can access government-run internet. He said the $1 per hour cost for wi-fi is onerous considering the average salary of roughly $30 per month. For internet access at home, Cubans must pay $17 to $80 per month, depending on speed, for only 30 hours of connectivity, Creamer said. ADVERTISEMENT He said Cubas government ""filters and blocks websites"" in a bid to impede the Cuban peoples ability to criticize government institutions and policies. ""Such acts of aggression have a chilling effect on the exercise of the fundamental freedom of expression,"" Creamer said. Internet access in Cuba, once rare and prohibitively expensive, has spread dramatically and dropped in price since Obama and Castros 2014 deal to normalize relations. There are 508 public WiFi access points across the country and Cuba has begun providing home internet access in cities across the country. The government also says it will begin offering mobile internet access this year. The Cuban internet is mostly uncensored. The state does block some sites, particularly those that receive U.S. funding such as the Office of Cuba Broadcastings Marti television network, but those sites channels can be freely accessed through third parties like Facebook and YouTube. Some of the likely recommendations for expanding access are technical. Tom Sullivan, chief of the FCCs international bureau, said there are no direct, undersea cables between the U.S. and Cuba, though he said there appear to be some U.S. satellites providing service in the island. There was no immediate reaction to the meeting from the Cuban Embassy. But ahead of the meeting, Cuba protested the task forces creation through diplomatic notes rejecting ""the goal of manipulating the internet to bring about illegal programs with subversive political ends."" Cubas Foreign Ministry said it ""reiterated the Cuban governments determination to not tolerate any type of subversive activity or interference in its internal affairs."" ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP",['Josh Lederman'],4/29/2021 0:49,'Tear down this firewall' - US looks to expand Cuba internet,"['state', 'president', 'force', 'meeting', 'access', 'task', 'internet', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'firewall', 'public', 'looks', 'expand', 'tear']","The Cuba Internet Task Force held its first public meeting over the objections of Cuban President Raul Castros government, which has dismissed it as an exercise in attempted subversion by Washington.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, May 1 (Reuters) - For a second consecutive year Communist-run Cuba canceled its emblematic May Day march though Havana's Plaza de la Revolution Square on Saturday as it battles a surge in COVID-19 cases and a scarcity of basic goods. Across the island, small groups of dignitaries gathered at abandoned squares that would usually be filled by crowds of banner-waving citizens marking International Workers Day, the country's most important holiday after Jan. 1, victory day of former leader Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. ""Congratulations workers! It is monumental what has been done to survive the pandemic under a reinforced blockade and still move forward,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is also first secretary of the Communist party, wrote on Twitter. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Cuba's economy shrunk 11% last year under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic, harsh U.S. sanctions and its Soviet-style system. The country has recorded more COVID-19 cases and deaths this year than in all of 2020, though the mortality rate remains among the best in the world and two homegrown vaccines are in final trials. Ulises Guilarte de Nascimiento, head of the official and only trade union federation, said on state-run television on Friday that workers faced layoffs and inflation and some struggled to ""meet their basic needs"". He blamed U.S. sanctions and said hard work and greater efficiency would lead to better days. Speaking on Saturday morning to a small group of national leaders gathered in front of the monument to independence hero Jose Marti in Revolution Square, he was defiant. ""We workers are aware that we are going through a complex and challenging scenario, but we also carry the conviction that Fidel taught us, that only those who fight, resist and do not give up have the right to succeed,"" he said. State-run media urged citizens to turn their homes into squares and share their celebrations on social media. Small groups of workers rallied at some workplaces. People hung flags from balconies and played the national anthem. ""Today is a special day, a sad day, because in all this time of the pandemic we have lost valuable workers,"" Havana resident Enrique Tondique Dominguez said early Saturday at a small rally in front of the Mining and Energy Ministry. ""It is a happy day because it is May Day, but it is also a sad day because many workers are no longer with us,"" he said.

U.S. officials on both sides of the political aisle issued statements on social media expressing their support of the demonstrations and expressed solidarity with the people of Cuba. They also shared footage, where protestors can be heard chanting ""we are not afraid."" According to Florida Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, Cuba's regime is shutting off internet on the island. ""The Castro dictatorship doesnt want the world to see whats happening,"" Salazar wrote. ""Please SHARE & stand with these freedom fighters!"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called out the mainstream media for refusing to provide extensive coverage on the unrest in Cuba. ""Attention US media ... in #Cuba they are rising up because socialism is (always a) disaster,"" Rubio tweeted. ""Are you going to report on this so the world can hear their voices?"" Rubio then urged President Joe Biden and Secretary Anthony Blinken to call on members of the Cuban military to not fire on their own people. ""The incompetent communist party of #Cuba cannot feed or protest the people from the virus,"" Rubio wrote. ""Now those in the military must defend the people not the communist party."" Rubio also slammed Twitter for suggesting that the mass protests were about raising COVID ""awareness"" in the country."" ""(Twitter) Ignores (that) this is really about how socialism is a disaster & always leads to tyranny, despair & suffering,"" Rubio wrote, sharing a screenshot of ""#SOSCuba"" trending on Twitter. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted that the ""Communist Cuban regime will be consigned to the dustbin of history. It has brutalized & denied freedom to generations of Cubans, and forced my family & so many others to flee. The American people stand squarely with the men & women of Cuba and their noble fight for liberty."" Florida U.S. Reps. Carlos A. Gimenez, Mario Diaz-Balart, and Maria Elvira Salazar, issued a joint statement in support of the protests in Cuba. ""Now more than ever, the United States and the international community must support the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. The humanitarian crisis Cuba faces right now is yet another symptom of the incompetence and absolute cruelty of the Cuban tyranny,"" the statement said. ""We know what freedom means for the Cuban people, and now, while the regime uses savage violence against the people peacefully demonstrating in the streets, the world has the obligation to stand with the brave Cuban people."" Meanwhile, demonstrations of solidarity with the Cuban protesters broke out a Cuban embassy in Argentina, and in Miami, where there is a sizable population of Cuban immigrants and descendants. Gelet Fragela, who runs the Miami-based Cuban news outlet ADN Cuba, told Fox News that the country has been clamping down on its media - including for ADN - for months leading up to the protests. ""Cuba, just like the Soviet Union, is an organized totalitarian regime that creates a false reality and sends that to the world,"" Fragela said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She said that Cuba has sent around 30,000 of its own doctors around the world, while neglecting the medical care needs of its own people at home. ""I wouldn't say this is a protest because of the lack of COVID vaccines, I think this is a protest for the people of Cuba asking for the regime to end once and for all after more than 60 years of repression,"" Fragela said.

11,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/street-protests-break-out-cuba-2021-07-11/,"HAVANA, July 11 (Reuters) - Chanting ""freedom"" and calling for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down, thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades. The protests erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, its old ally, and a record surge in coronavirus infections, with people voicing anger over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. Thousands took to the streets in various parts of Havana including the historic centre, their shouts of ""Diaz-Canel step down"" drowning out groups of government supporters waving the Cuban flag and chanting ""Fidel."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Special forces jeeps, with machine guns mounted on the back were seen throughout the capital and the police presence was heavy even long after most protesters had gone home by the 9 p.m. curfew in place due to the pandemic. ""We are going through really difficult times,"" Miranda Lazara, 53, a dance teacher, who joined the thousands of protesters who marched through Havana. ""We need a change of system."" Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, blamed the unrest on old Cold War foe the United States, which in recent years tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island, in a televised speech on Sunday afternoon. Diaz-Canel said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and ""mercenaries"" on the ground, and warned that further ""provocations"" would not be tolerated, calling on supporters to confront ""provocations."" The president was due to make another address to the nation at 9 a.m. on Monday, according to state-run media. Julie Chung, acting undersecretary of the U.S. State Department's Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said it was deeply concerned by ""calls to combat"" in Cuba and stood by the Cuban peoples right for peaceful assembly."" Reuters witnesses in Havana protests saw security forces, aided by suspected plain clothes officers, arrest about two dozen protesters. Police used pepper spray and hit some protesters as well as a photographer working for the Associated Press. In one area of Havana, protesters took out their anger on an empty police car, rolling it over and then throwing stones at it. Elsewhere, they chanted ""repressors"" at riot police. Some protesters said they went on to the streets to join in after seeing what was happening on social media, which has become an increasingly important factor since the introduction of mobile internet two and a half years ago, although connections were patchy on Sunday. NATIONWIDE PROTESTS 1/5 People shout slogans against the government during a protest against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Read More The Caribbean island nation of 11 million inhabitants where public dissident is usually restricted has seen a growing number of protests over the past year although nothing on this scale or simultaneously in so many cities. The anti-government demonstrations were the largest since the summer of 1994, said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University. ""Only now, they weren't limited to the capital; they didn't even start there, it seems,"" he said. Sunday's demonstrations broke out at around midday in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana. Video on social media showed hundreds of residents chanting anti-government slogans and demanding everything from coronavirus vaccines to an end of daily blackouts. ""I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,"" resident Claris Ramirez said by phone. ""They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine"". President Diaz-Canel visited the town, later saying in his broadcast remarks: ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations"". There were protests later on Sunday hundreds of miles to the east in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba, where social media video showed hundreds marching through the streets, again confirmed by a resident. ""They are protesting the crisis, that there is no food or medicine, that you have to buy everything at the foreign currency stores, and on and on the list goes,"" the resident, Claudia Perez, said. The protests in Havana started around 3 p.m. and fizzled out around 8 p.m., with some protesters giving up after security forces thwarted their attempt to reach Revolution Square Cuba has been experiencing a worsening economic crisis for two years, which the government blames mainly on U.S. sanctions and the pandemic, while its detractors cite incompetence and a Soviet-style one-party system. A combination of sanctions, inefficiencies and the pandemic has shut down tourism and slowed other foreign revenue flows in a country dependent on them to import the bulk of its food, fuel and inputs for agriculture and manufacturing. The economy contracted 10.9% last year, and 2% through June of 2021. The resulting cash crunch has spawned shortages that have forced Cubans to queue for hours for basic goods throughout the pandemic. Cuba has begun a mass vaccination campaign, with 1.7 million of its 11.2 million residents vaccinated to date and twice that many have received at least one shot in the three-shot process. Still, the arrival of the Delta variant has prompted cases to surge, with health authorities reporting a record 6,923 cases and 47 deaths on Sunday - twice as many as the previous week. Hospitals in the worst affected province have been overwhelmed.

Thousands of people marched through San Antonio de los Banos, southwest of Havana, with videos streaming live on Facebook for nearly an hour before they suddenly disappeared. As the afternoon wore on, other videos appeared from demonstrations elsewhere, including Palma Soriano, in the countrys southeast. Hundreds of people also gathered in Havana, where a heavy police presence preceded their arrival. ""The people are dying of hunger!"" one woman shouted during a protest filmed in the province of Artemisa, in the islands west. ""Our children are dying of hunger!"" One clip circulating on Twitter showed protesters overturning a police car in Cardenas, 90 miles east of Havana. Another video showed people looting from one of the much-detested government-run stores, which sell wildly overpriced items in currencies most Cubans do not possess.",['Frances Robles'],7/11/2021 21:13,Cubans Denounce 'Misery' in Biggest Protests in Decades,"['havana', 'videos', 'showed', 'decades', 'protest', 'nearly', 'dying', 'yearsthousands', 'wore', 'protests', 'cubans', 'woman', 'biggest', 'misery', 'denounce']","Thousands of people marched through San Antonio de los Banos, southwest of Havana, with videos streaming live on Facebook for nearly an hour before they suddenly disappeared.

13,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/americas/cuba-protests/index.html,"Havana, Cuba (CNN) Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. Demonstrators complained about a lack of freedom and the worsening economic situation during the rare protests, according to people who spoke to CNN and videos from multiple cities, including capital Havana. Many chanted for ""freedom"" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down. Multiple protesters were arrested by police, who used tear gas to break up some demonstrations. In Havana, a CNN team witnessed demonstrators being forcibly arrested and thrown into the back of vans by police officers. There were also violent clashes, where protesters turned over a police car and threw rocks at officers. In a nationally televised address, President Diaz-Canel said US trade sanctions had created economic misery on the communist-run island. Diaz-Canel did not offer the protesters any concessions in his speech, but instead urged his supporters to physically confront them. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance, ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets."" In the city of San Antonio de los Banos, just outside Havana province, hundreds of people defied a heavy police presence to air their complaints. One resident who did not wish to be identified told CNN that residents had been enduring power outages for a week and that had ""detonated"" the growing outrage. Social media platforms are being restricted in Cuba, according to internet monitor NetBlocks. NetBlocks tweeted on Monday that ""Social media and messaging platforms restricted in #Cuba from Monday on state-run internet provider ETECSA; real-time network data corroborate reports of internet disruptions amid widening anti-government protests; incident ongoing #CubaSOS."" The NetBlocks website said its metrics showed that WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and some Telegram servers were being disrupted. Videos uploaded to social media showed how the spontaneous protest movement has gained momentum, with streams appearing of other protests in a handful of cities and towns across the island. In some of the videos, people shouted they ""weren't afraid"" or that they wanted liberty or access to coronavirus vaccines. President Diaz-Canel made an unplanned stop in San Antonio de los Banos on Sunday after police had cleared protesters, while Cuban government officials blamed the protests on ""salaried agents"" on Twitter. Calls for restraint On Monday, US President Joe Biden called on the Diaz-Canel government to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also tweeted on Sunday night, ""the U.S. supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights."" Other US officials also urged for restraint, saying Cubans had the right to protest. ""We are deeply concerned by ""calls to combat"" in #Cuba. We stand by the Cuban people's right for peaceful assembly. We call for calm and condemn any violence,"" Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, tweeted Sunday. ""For decades, Cuba's dictatorship has used violence and repression to silence its people, rather than permit the free exercise of democracy and their basic social rights,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez said in a statement. ""This must end. The world's eyes are on Cuba tonight and the dictatorship must understand we will not tolerate the use of brute force to silence the aspirations of the Cuban people,"" he added. Other world leaders have also weighed in, with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro criticizing socialist regimes on the continent. People went on the streets to ask for ""freedom,"" and received ""rubber bullets, beatings, and prison,"" he said. Strained US-Cuba relations But statements from US leaders have prompted angry criticism from Cuban authorities, who argue that US sanctions are the cause of Cuba's ailing economy. US-Cuban relations are at their lowest point in years. The Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, and so far, the Biden administration seems reluctant to lift them The already struggling Cuban economy has been hit hard as tourism and good imports have dropped steeply during the pandemic. On Sunday, Cuban health officials reported a record single-day increase for new Covid-19 cases and deaths President Diaz-Canel criticized the protests, calling demonstrators vandals who ""broke into the stores and stole [many] items."" He pointed to ""restrictive measures"" by the Trump administration that caused ""a very rough period of time, where we were going to have many difficulties and economic scarcities."" Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez also criticized Sullivan's statement on Monday, saying he had ""no political or moral authority to speak about Cuba."" ""His government has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to promote subversion in our country & implements a genocidal blockade, which is the main cause of economic scarcities,"" Rodriguez added in a tweet. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also called on the US to suspend their Cuba trade embargo as a humanitarian gesture. ""No country in the world should be fenced in, blockaded -- that's the opposite of human rights,"" he said. When asked why Biden had not yet reversed Trump's policies towards Cuba, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the US had continued to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies -- but added, ""I have nothing to preview for you in terms of a change of policy."" In a statement on Sunday, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken pushed back against criticisms from the Cuban government, saying ""it would be a grievous mistake for the Cuban regime to interpret what is happening in dozens of towns and cities across the island as the result or product of anything the United States has done."" ""That is what we are hearing and seeing in Cuba, and that is a reflection of the Cuban people, not of the United States or any other outside actor,"" he said.","['Patrick Oppmann', 'Tatiana Arias']",7/11/2021 22:17,Cubans take to streets in rare protests over lack of freedoms and worsening economy,"['cnn', 'streets', 'president', 'freedoms', 'biden', 'cuban', 'protests', 'rare', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'freedom', 'economic', 'lack', 'economy', 'violence', 'worsening', 'protesters']","Havana, Cuba (CNN) Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets in rare anti-government protests in Cuba, where the coronavirus pandemic and an economic crisis are spurring frustrations, with some demonstrators chanting ""down with the dictatorship"" and ""we want liberty."" At a protest on Sunday in San Antonio de los Banos, a town of some 50,000 people southwest of Havana, mainly young people shouted insults against President Miguel Diaz-Canel, according to videos posted online. ""We are not afraid,"" some said. ""I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,"" local resident Claris Ramirez told the Reuters news agency by phone. ""They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine,"" she added. Thousands of people also gathered in downtown Havana and along parts of the seaside drive amid a heavy police presence, while protests took place later in the day in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba. Police drive near people during protests against and in support of the Cuban government, in Havana on July 11 [Stringer/Reuters] The demonstrations came as Cuba is experiencing its toughest phase yet of the coronavirus crisis, and the same day it reported a new daily record of infections and deaths. Social anger has been driven by long food lines and a critical shortage of medicines since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, with Cuba under United States sanctions. Diaz-Canel late on Sunday afternoon addressed the nation, accusing the US of being responsible for the unrest. He warned that further ""provocations"" would not be tolerated. Havana-based journalist Ed Augustin said there was a heavy police presence in the capital. He said Diaz-Canel in his speech to the country called on people who support the Cuban revolution to come out to defend it. ""These are the biggest protests in Cuba for decades,"" Augustin told Al Jazeera. CUBA: Social media videos of rare anti-government protests in various cities amid reports of gas, electricity and vaccine shortages. President Miguel Diaz-Canel responds, calls it a provocation and calls on supporters of the revolution to take to the streets. -- Gabriel Elizondo (@elizondogabriel) July 11, 2021 Washington meanwhile reacted swiftly to the days events. ""The US supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights,"" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Twitter. Cuba was left relatively unscathed in the first months of the coronavirus outbreak, but it has seen a recent increase in infections. A new record of 6,923 daily cases was reported on Sunday, along with 47 additional deaths. ""These are alarming numbers which are increasing daily,"" said Francisco Duran, head of epidemiology in the health ministry. The country has been developing five of its own COVID-19 vaccines and last month said one of them, called Abdalla, showed 92 percent efficiency. Cuban doctors and nurses have been fanning out across the capital in an effort to encourage jabs, hoping inoculations will help stem the rising infection numbers.",[],7/11/2021 22:38,Thousands join rare anti-government protests in Cuba,"['havana', 'videos', 'daily', 'toughest', 'support', 'thousands', 'protests', 'rare', 'join', 'cuba', 'town', 'antigovernment', 'coronavirus', 'told']","Demonstrations come as Cuba is experiencing its toughest phase yet of the coronavirus crisis.

Hundreds of demonstrators went out to the streets in several cities in Cuba to protest against ongoing food shortages and high prices of foodstuffs, amid the new coronavirus crisis. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) HAVANA (AP) -- Thousands of Cubans marched on Havanas Malecon promenade and elsewhere on the island Sunday to protest food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis, in one of biggest anti-government demonstrations in memory. Many young people took part in the afternoon protest in the capital, which disrupted traffic until police moved in after several hours and broke up the march when a few protesters threw rocks. Police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted ""Freedom,"" ""Enough"" and ""Unite."" One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-age protester told The Associated Press. He declined to identify himself for fear of being arrested later. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. ADVERTISEMENT An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sundays demonstrations. ""Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need,"" tweeted Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for Western Hemisphere affairs. Cubas director general for U.S. affairs, Carlos F. de Cossio, dismissed her remarks in his own tweet: ""US State Department and its officials, involved to their necks in promoting social and political instability in #Cuba, should avoid expressing hypocritical concern for a situation they have been betting on. Cuba is and will continue to be a peaceful country, contrary to the US."" The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages. People standing on many balconies along the central artery in the Centro Habana neighborhood applauded the protesters passing by. Others joined in the march. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. ""The people came out to express themselves freely, and they are repressing and beating them,"" Rev. Jorge Luis Gil, a Roman Catholic priest, said while standing at a street corner in Centro Habana. About 300 people close to the government then arrived with a large Cuban flag shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. Some people from the group assaulted an AP videojournalist, disabling his camera, while an AP photojournalist was injured by the police. Demonstrations were also held elsewhere on the island, including the small town of San Antonio de los Banos, where people protested power outages and were visited by President Miguel Diaz-Canel. He entered a few homes, where he took questions from residents. Afterward, though, he accused Cuban of stirring up trouble. ""As if pandemic outbreaks had not existed all over the world, the Cuban-American mafia, paying very well on social networks to influencers and Youtubers, has created a whole campaign ... and has called for demonstrations across the country,"" Diaz-Canel told reporters.",['Andrea Rodriguez'],7/11/2021 22:44,"Demonstrators in Havana protest shortages, rising prices","['prices', 'havana', 'rising', 'protest', 'protester', 'cuban', 'ap', 'crisis', 'cuba', 'shortages', 'coronavirus', 'demonstrators', 'protesters']","Plainclothes police detain an anti-government protester during a protest in Havana, Cuba, Sunday, July 11, 2021.

16,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/thousands-protesters-take-streets-cuba-n1273664,"HAVANA -- Thousands of Cubans took to the streets from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in rarely seen protests, expressing frustration over pandemic restrictions, the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations and what they said was government neglect. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, blamed the United States for the unrest in a nationally televised speech Sunday afternoon. Special forces jeeps with machine guns mounted on the back were seen in Havana, and Diaz-Canel called on supporters to confront ""provocations."" Thousands of people gathered in downtown Havana and along parts of the seaside drive amid a heavy police presence. There were a few arrests and scuffles, but no major confrontations. The protests broke out in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana, with video on social media showing hundreds of residents chanting anti-government slogans and demanding everything from coronavirus vaccines to an end to daily blackouts. People take part in a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on Sunday. ADALBERTO ROQUE / AFP - Getty Images ""I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,"" local resident Claris Ramirez said by phone. ""They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine,"" she added. Diaz-Canel, who had just returned from San Antonio de los Banos, said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and ""mercenaries"" on the ground, and he warned that further ""provocations"" would not be tolerated. There were protests later on Sunday hundreds of miles to the east in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba, where social media video showed hundreds marching through the streets, again confirmed by a local resident. ""They are protesting the crisis, that there is no food or medicine, that you have to buy everything at the foreign currency stores, and on and on the list goes,"" Claudia Perez said. ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations,"" Diaz-Canel said in his broadcast remarks. The Communist-run country has been experiencing a worsening economic crisis for two years, which the government blames mainly on U.S. sanctions and the pandemic, while its detractors cite incompetence and a Soviet-style one-party system.",[],7/11/2021 22:54,Thousands of protesters take to the streets in Cuba,"['streets', 'havana', 'media', 'video', 'protesting', 'seen', 'thousands', 'protests', 'cuba', 'social', 'hundreds', 'diazcanel', 'protesters']","HAVANA -- Thousands of Cubans took to the streets from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in rarely seen protests, expressing frustration over pandemic restrictions, the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations and what they said was government neglect.

Anti-government protests erupt in Cuba as the government struggles to deal with the pandemic. (AP) Thousands of Cubans across the country took part in rare protests against the communist government, marching through several towns as they called for democracy and liberty. The demonstrations started in the morning on Sunday, as the country endures its worst economic crisis in 30 years. The only authorised gatherings are normally Communist Party events. Several thousand protesters took to the streets of San Antonio de los Banos, a town of some 50,000 people, 30 kilometres (20 miles) southwest of Havana. Some of the demonstrators, mainly young people, shouted insults against President Miguel Diaz-Canel.

Diaz-Canel blamed US sanctions imposed by Donald Trump and left unchanged by President Joe Biden for misery people are facing. He accused ""a Cuban-American mafia"" of whipping up the protests on social media. ""People have come to express their dissatisfaction with the situation they are living in,"" he said. One local, on condition of anonymity, told AFP that she participated in the demonstration as she was exasperated by ""the situation with electricity and food."" Public anger Protests also erupted in Havana, with a few hundred people present, while social media showed other demonstrations in the country. Public anger has been driven by long food lines, worsening power shortages for several hours a day and a critical shortage of medicines since the start of the Covid-19 epidemic, with Cuba under US sanctions. Cuba is experiencing its toughest phase yet of the coronavirus epidemic, and on Sunday reported a new daily record of infections and deaths. The country of 11.2 million people was left relatively unscathed in the first months of the Covid outbreak but has seen a recent hike in infections, with a new record of 6,923 daily cases reported Sunday and 47 deaths for a total of 1,537.

The anti-government protest in the capital of Havana lasted about 2  1/2  hours before it was broken up when a few protesters tossed cobblestones at police, leading to several arrests. Before its conclusion, hordes of demonstrators, many of them young, marched around the capital chanting ""Freedom,"" ""Enough"" and ""Unite"" with police trailing behind them. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-aged protester told The Associated Press. The communist country is suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades and has recently seen a surge in coronavirus cases. The protesters demonstrated against recent food shortages and high prices in Cuba during the countrys current economic crisis.

20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/11/biden-administration-claims-cuban-anti-communist-protests-are-about-rising-covid-cases-deaths/,"President Joe Bidens administration responded to protests in Cuba against the Communist regime on Sunday by issuing a statement through a minor official commending protests ""about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages."" On Sunday, protests broke out in Havana and several other Cuban cities, during which people chanted ""Freedom!"" and ""Down with the dictatorship!"" while marching against Communist Party institutions. The New York Times noted that while the demonstrations were triggered by ""food and medicine shortages,"" they also ""openly protested against the Communist government"" for the first time in nearly 30 years. Some activists called it the largest spontaneous popular protest since Fidel Castro took power in 1959, with protesters openly denouncing the regime of Miguel Diaz-Canel.

Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need. -- Julie Chung (@WHAAsstSecty) July 11, 2021 The administrations statement ignored democracy and freedom altogether. Cubans do not have the ""right to peaceful assembly""; like many rights in the Cuban Constitution, it exists only in theory. The Biden administrations attempt to spin the protests as a demonstration about COVID-19 mirrors the rhetoric of the 2020 presidential election, during which Democrats charged that the Trump administration had failed on the pandemic. It could also be an effort to defend the Obama administrations ""normalization"" policy toward Cuba, in which then-Vice President Biden participated, which restored full diplomatic relations with the regime but failed to demand democratic reforms or progress on human rights.

21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/-are-no-longer-afraid-thousands-cubans-protest-government-rcna1386,"Thousands of Cubans took to the streets across the country on Sunday in an unusual protest in which civilians shouted slogans against the Communist government, such as ""We want freedom"" and ""We are no longer afraid."" The demonstrations came at a time when Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, an increase in repression against political opponents and a strained health system during a critical stage of the pandemic. Health authorities reported almost 7,000 new cases and 47 deaths -- a record for infections and deaths on the Caribbean island of just over 11 million people. In Miami, hundreds of people gathered in the Little Havana neighborhood in solidarity with the growing protests in Cuba. ""I know my family in Cuba is struggling, people are dying. Its terrible,"" Miami resident Christian Guzman told NBC station WTVJ. ""Right now its hard. Theres no food, theres no medicine. The Covid outbreak. The whole country is in the streets,"" another Miami resident, Dario Suarez, said. People take part in a demonstration in Havana, on July 11, 2021. Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images In Cuba, the protests began early Sunday afternoon in the municipality of San Antonio de los Banos, in the Artemisa province, adjacent to Havana. A few hours later they had spread to the east of the country, in provinces such as Santiago de Cuba. The central Malecon of the capital, where in August 1994 Cubans staged a historic protest against then-leader Fidel Castro that was violently repressed, also saw hundreds of protesters gather on Sunday. Cubans in several provinces contacted by Noticias Telemundo confirmed that the government, which controls the only internet provider company on the island, has caused service outages to prevent live broadcasts. ""They do not want the world to see what is happening in Cuba,"" said a resident from Havana who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals from the regime. President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on national television to call on the Army to confront the protesters: ""The order to fight has been given,"" he said. In Cuba, videos broadcast on social networks, which could be verified by Noticias Telemundo, show special agents known in Cuba as Black Berets, being deployed in some localities and violently detaining civilians who protested and sang peacefully. Diaz-Canel also called ""all the revolutionaries in the country, all the communists, to take to the streets and go to the places where these provocations are going to take place."" In recent days, Cuban exiles and high-profile personalities have joined the #SOSCuba campaign to demand that the islands authorities open a humanitarian channel that allows the entry of medicines and supplies to treat the almost 240,000 patients with coronavirus. The authorities have mocked the initiative on national television and described it as an attempt to discredit the governments management of the health crisis, which has the islands hospitals on the edge. Cubans whose relatives have died from coronavirus in recent days have gone on social networks to talk about the seriousness of the health crisis, which currently has its epicenter in the province of Matanzas, known for Varadero, a popular beach resort town. ""My mother just died. We were in isolation for four days. Four days calling the SIUM (Integrated System of Medical Emergencies) to come and look for her. Four days and the SIUM did not arrive,"" said Magdiel Matos outside a hospital in Matanzas. Opposition artists and independent journalists have said for weeks that the government has maintained police patrols outside their homes, while reports persist of patients who could not be transferred to hospitals on time due to lack of transportation and resources. ""Take these patrols to transport the sick, open the hotels to house them, facilitate the arrival of donated medicines and medical utensils,"" poet and activist Katherine Bisquet said from Havana, pointing out a police car stationed in the basement of the building. Cuba did not join COVAX, the World Health Organization agency that seeks to disseminate Covid-19 vaccines in poorer countries, instead betting on the production of its own vaccines. One of those five vaccine candidates, Abdala, received approval for emergency use this week. The government has stated that the vaccine, the first produced in Latin America, is 92.8 percent effective after three doses, but has not published data on clinical studies and it hasn't received the approval of any international health organization. In Miami, with the largest community of Cuban exiles in the U.S., Cuban-born congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar said, ""We have not seen in recent years a popular uprising as big as this one."" Mass protests are rare on the island and, when they do occur, they are quickly put down. Cuban politicians and the official press, the only one allowed by law in Cuba, often discredit dissidents by saying that they respond to the interests of the United States and that they receive funding for subversion. The acting deputy secretary of the U.S. State Departments Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Julie Chung, defended the protests on Twitter, saying that peaceful protests were growing as people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express their concern over the increase in Covid-19 cases and deaths. The coronavirus crisis, which caused the closure of airports and slowed tourism by more than 80 percent -- Cubas second source of income after its medical missions -- has exacerbated the shortage and fueled popular discontent. The Cuban government attributes the economic crisis to U.S. embargo against Cuba and sanctions, which former President Donald Trump intensified. The Biden Administration has shown no signs of wanting to roll back sanctions, instead demanding that the government release political prisoners and respect dissenting voices. An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.","['Jorge Carrasco', 'Noticias Telemundo', 'Jorge Carrasco Is A Digital Reporter At Noticias Telemundo.']",7/12/2021 7:29,'We are no longer afraid': Thousands of Cubans protest against the government,"['havana', 'longer', 'telemundo', 'protest', 'health', 'cuban', 'thousands', 'protests', 'miami', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'country', 'afraid', 'days', 'crisis']","In Miami, hundreds of people gathered in the Little Havana neighborhood in solidarity with the growing protests in Cuba.

DEM SOCIALISTS MUM ON PROTESTS But Diaz-Canel blamed the U.S. for the protests, claiming the American government has not only limited Cuba's access to goods but also paid people to protest. Diaz-Canal said protesters are a ""counterrevolutionary, mercenary"" group paid by the U.S. government to ""assemble these types of demonstrations."" ""The moment that we have to focus on is how to attend to what is problematic, how to achieve financial capacity,"" Diaz-Canal said in a video clip posted to Twitter. ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations,"" Diaz-Canel said on Sunday, according to Reuters.

23,https://nypost.com/2021/07/12/cuba-blames-us-for-uprising-against-communist-regime/,"Cubas Communist regime is trying to blame the US for the huge uprising against its totalitarian government -- as it also calls on ""revolutionaries"" to take to the streets and ""fight"" any anti-government protesters. On Sunday, thousands took to the streets in cities and towns across the long-suffering nation, screaming ""Freedom"" and ""Enough"" -- as well as anti-government slogans and demands for the removal of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The dictatorship responded with a huge police presence, dispatching special forces jeeps with machine guns mounted on the back. Dozens of demonstrators were arrested in the countrys capital, Havana. There were also clashes with government supporters, who were blamed for assaulting journalists as Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon to stop news getting out.

""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations,"" he said in an ominous warning.

""It can end today and it must end today,"" he said, according to NBC-6. Protesters take to the streets in Miami to protest the Cuban Communist regime on July 11, 2021.

An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sundays demonstrations. ""Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages,"" tweeted Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for Western Hemisphere affairs.

US national security adviser Jake Sullivan also said that ""the US supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights."" The message was echoed by numerous US lawmakers. A demonstrators protests in front of workers of the Institute of Radio and Television in Havana, Cuba. EPA/Ernesto Mastrascusa ""Its time for the Cuban regime to step down and let Democracy flourish in Cuba,"" tweeted Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he will ask President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to urge members of the Cuban military to stand with the people of Cuba. ""The incompetent communist party of #Cuba cannot feed or protect the people from the virus,"" he tweeted. ""Now those in the military must defend the people not the communist party,"" he tweeted. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), who represents the Miami area, said the ""humanitarian crisis Cuba faces right now is yet another symptom of the incompetence and absolute cruelty of the Cuban tyranny."" ""The world has the obligation to stand with the brave Cuban people,"" Salazar said in a statement. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, also urged the US to ""stand in solidarity with the brave people of Cuba that are risking their lives today for change in their country and a future of Patria y Vida."" People partaking in the protests -- which are very uncommon in Cuba -- on July 11, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Cubas director-general for US affairs, Carlos F. de Cossio, lashed out at the US support of the uprising. ""US State Department and its officials, involved to their necks in promoting social and political instability in #Cuba, should avoid expressing hypocritical concern for a situation they have been betting on,"" de Cossio tweeted. ""Cuba is and will continue to be a peaceful country, contrary to the US."" The demonstrations -- the biggest anti-government protests on the Communist-run island in decades -- were largely stoked by Cubas worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, its old ally, 30 years ago.

""We are going through really difficult times,"" said Miranda Lazara, 53, a dance teacher, who joined the thousands of protesters who marched through Havana. ""We need a change of system.""

24,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-thousands-nationwide-take-streets-against-communism/,"Thousands of Cubans in at least 16 cities took the streets peacefully on Sunday to demand an end to the 62-year-old communist regime, chanting ""freedom,"" wearing American flags, and in many cases facing extreme police repression. Videos from throughout the island show both plain-clothed and uniformed state security officers attacking peaceful protesters. In Havana, bystanders recorded the sound of heavy gunfire and public beatings of dissidents. Miguel Diaz-Canel, the ""president"" appointed by Raul Castro to be the face of the still-ruling Castro Communist Party, called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime in a speech on Sunday. The protests appeared to begin in the town of San Antonio de los Banos, western Cuba, on Sunday morning. Local independent outlets documented chants of ""down with communism!"", ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"", among other anti-government statements. Locals livestreamed the protest on Facebook, triggering an outpouring into the streets of at least 16 major cities including both Havana and Santiago de Cuba, on opposite ends of the island. The geographically widespread nature of the protests and the secrecy of the Communist Party on the island has made it virtually impossible to estimate exactly how many Cubans took the streets on Sunday. Police have not released any arrest totals or injury statistics, but some local outlets estimate that hundreds were arrested, taken into police stations but not formally charged or appearing in any law enforcement documentation. Among the arrested were several Cuban journalists not participating but reporting on the protests, according to the dissident news service Cubanet. Also arrested on Sunday, though rapidly released, was Yomil Hidalgo, one of Cubas most popular dance music artists. The American flag, popularized as a protest symbol in Cuba by dissident Daniel Llorente, made multiple appearances among Cubans on Sunday. Video authenticated by the Miami broadcaster AmericaTeve showed a group of Cubans carrying an American flag through the streets of Havana on Sunday while chanting ""freedom!"" Videos taken by Cubans on social media and distributed through other Latin American news organizations also show the presence of the U.S. flag. In Mayabeque, a Havana suburb, a crowd of hundreds congregated in front of an image of the Virgin Mary to pray for an end to the communist regime. At least one participant can be seen wearing an American flag shirt while praying. Pre-Castro Cuba was a majority Catholic nation. Under communism, the regime has outlawed most religious practices it cannot control and regularly persecutes Christians who defy its authority. Fidel Castro sent non-Catholic Christians - primarily Jehovahs Witnesses and Seventh-Day Adventists - to labor camps alongside suspected LGBT people, writers and critics, and other ""undesirables"" in the 1960s. Reports of the beating and arrest of at least one Catholic priest, Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, surfaced on Sunday. Alvarez reportedly disappeared in Camaguey, one of the most active protest centers, and resurfaced under the custody of the Communist Partys secret police. Camaguey, in the central rural heartland of the island, experienced some of the most violent communist repression on Sunday. Local journalists and citizens recorded police publicly beating protesters. Citizens fought back with rocks - legal weapon ownership in communist Cuba does not exist - in at least one occasion successfully pushing back a police car to protect dissidents in one neighborhood. Citizens appear to begin throwing rocks after police open fire on unarmed, peaceful civilians, hitting at least one man. An extremely dramatic video of Cuban citizens overturning a police car and standing on it in triumph also surfaced on Sunday. Sources differ on where it was taken, but it appears to be in either Havana or Cardenas, a city about 100 miles east of the capital. Other reports indicated heavy gunfire from police at peaceful protesters in Havana. As Havana is one of Cubas most densely populated urban centers, opening fire on a tightly packed crowd would likely result in significant injuries, but Cuban authorities have not issued any reports on the damage police caused at press time. The gunfire was an apparent attempt to keep protesters out of the Plaza of the Revolution, the Spain-based Diario de Cuba reported. The Plaza is the crown jewel of communist architecture in Havana, featuring Soviet-style metal portraits of Fidel Castro, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, and other mass murderers. Diario de Cuba, citing a reporter on the ground, stated that police surrounded the Plaza and deployed a communist mob to wave photos of Fidel Castro. Police carrying baseball bats offered protection to the state-sponsored mob. Photos of the pro-Castro mob in Havana appeared in Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, late Sunday appear to confirm those reports. Diaz-Canel appeared on television Sunday to call all communists to violently attack any protesters, effectively urging civil war. ""We are willing to give our lives. They will have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution,"" Diaz-Canel warned. ""We are willing to do anything."" ""We are convening all revolutionary communists to go out to the streets where these provocations are happening and confront them with firmness,"" he commanded. ""The order of combat is issued, revolutionaries to the streets.""

The streets of Havana were quiet on Monday, although there was a heavy police presence and the capitol building, where more than a thousand had congregated the day before, was cordoned off. Outages in mobile internet - the only way many Cubans have of accessing the web - were frequent. Thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades. They were protesting against the country's dire economic crisis and handling of the pandemic, but many went further, calling for an end to communism and chanting ""freedom."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register At least 100 protesters, activists, and independent journalists had been detained nationwide since Sunday, according to exiled rights group Cubalex - some at the protests but others as they tried to leave their homes. ""It's becoming impossible to live here,"" said Havana resident Maykel, 21, who declined to give his surname for fear of retaliation. ""I don't know if this can happen again, because at the moment, Havana is militarized."" ""Still, Cubans are losing their fear,"" he said. Others Reuters spoke to said they hoped there would be no more protests, citing fears of violence, and saying they would prefer there to be more dialogue. The protests erupted amid both Cuba's deepest economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union and a surge in COVID-19 infections that has pushed some hospitals to the edge of collapse in a country that prides itself on its healthcare system. The tightening of decades-old U.S. sanctions under former U.S. President Donald Trump and the pandemic have exacerbated shortages of food and medicine, as well as power outages. A minority of counter-revolutionaries were fomenting unrest, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a more than four-hour-long televised address alongside his Cabinet. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez blamed U.S.-financed mercenaries. In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden said the United States stood with the people of Cuba who were ""bravely"" asserting their right to peaceful protest, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Cuban officials should not blame the protests on U.S. sanctions. ""It would be a grievous mistake because it would show that they simply are not hearing the voices and will of the Cuban people,"" he told a news briefing. Some Cuban celebrities who have to date not touched on sensitive political issues publicly came out in support of the protesters. ""Their voices should be heard and their rights to express themselves respected,"" said singer-songwriter Cimafunk, whose real name is Erik Rodriguez. ""We need to unite and find the path forward together, peacefully."" In Miami, home to a large community of Cuban Americans, hundreds turned out in Little Havana on Sunday to express solidarity and celebrate what they viewed as the beginning of the end. On Twitter, Miami mayor Francis Suarez implored the United States to ""take action."" VIOLENCE Diaz-Canel denounced vandalism that took place during the demonstrations. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel talks to the media, in San Antonio de los Banos, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini ""They threw stones at foreign currency shops, they stole items... and at police forces, they turned over cars - a totally vulgar, indecent and delinquent behavior,"" he said. But the president said pro-government supporters had finally restored order, after on Sunday instructing them to fight back and ""defend the revolution"" - orders that caused consternation among some Cubans. Reuters witnesses saw protesters in Havana on Sunday confronted by smaller pro-government counter-rallies, while police officers stopped their attempt to march to Revolution Square. Amnesty International said it had received with alarm reports of ""internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force - including police firing on demonstrators."" Reuters was unable to independently verify the use of firearms. Network monitoring company Kentik said it had observed the entire country go offline for less than 30 minutes at around 4pm on Sunday, followed by several hours of intermittent outages. ""Until very recently, large internet outages were very rare,"" said Doug Madory, Kentik's director of Internet analysis. ""Internet shutdowns are new to Cuba in 2021."" Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks said there was partial disruption to social media and messaging platforms in Cuba on Monday, ""likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba."" The United Nations said it was monitoring the protests and called for the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be respected. Jose Daniel, the leader of Cuba's largest opposition group, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), was arrested as he left home to join the protest in Santiago de Cuba in the east of the country on Sunday. His whereabouts is unknown, UNPACU activist Zaqueo Baez told Reuters. Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and Amaury Pacheco, two members of a dissident artists' collective that has made headlines spearheading a broader protest movement in Cuba in recent years, were arrested on their way to protest in Havana, Pacheco's partner Iris Ruiz told Reuters. Otero Alcantara was in jail while Pacheco's whereabouts were unknown. Another well-known dissident, Coco Farinas, was arrested as he left home on Monday in the central town of Santa Clara, his mother Alicia Fernandez told Reuters. The Cuban government did not immediately comment on the arrests. Cuba slams dissidents as mercenaries in the pay of the United States and allied with anti-Castro Cuban exiles. ""It feels like a dangerous moment,"" Ruiz said by phone, noting her neighborhood had had no mobile data all day. ""I'm worried about the kind of reprisals they could take against activists - they have been increasingly plying the theory that we are terrorists lately."" Julie Chung, Acting Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, called for the immediate release of them and others. Diaz-Canel attacked what he called Washington's hypocrisy for expressing concern when it was fueling the crisis in Cuba with its trade embargo. The United States tightened sanctions on Cuba under Trump, including restricting crucial remittances in the middle of the pandemic. Biden vowed during his campaign to ease some of these measures but has yet to do so, with the White House saying it was not among his top priorities. ""Is it not very hypocritical and cynical that you block me... and you want to present yourself as the big savior?"" he said. He said the government had been fighting to keep the economy functioning ""in the face of a policy of economic asphyxiation intended to provoke a social uprising.""

Thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations in Communist-run Cuba in decades. They chanted ""freedom"" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down.

""The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights, and we call on the government... to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba,"" Biden said. He declined to answer questions about whether the United States would alter its policy toward Cuba, and White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki gave no indication of an immediate shift. Biden's administration has been reviewing its approach to Cuba since he took over from Republican President Donald Trump, who had closed the door to increased tourism to the Caribbean island nation opened up by Democratic President Barack Obama. ""We are assessing how we can be helpful to the people of Cuba,"" Psaki said. The protests erupted amid both Cuba's worst economic crisis since the 1990s and a record surge in coronavirus infections. People denounced shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected,"" Biden said in a statement earlier on Monday. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" Diaz-Canel on Monday blamed U.S. sanctions, which were tightened in recent years, for problems such as medicine shortages and power outages. Psaki said U.S. policy still allowed significant amounts of aid to get through to Havana.

Republicans are pointing to unrest in Cuba as evidence that socialist policies ultimately fail, despite a trend among far-left Democrats to embrace them. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana over the weekend to lash out at the worsening conditions in the country under the communist regime, as Cuba faces its worst economic crisis in decades. CUBAN ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTERS WAVE AMERICAN FLAGS DURING MARCH ""Socialism leads to pain and suffering and Cuba is the perfect example,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a statement. ""Biden must pressure Cuba to provide assurances that they will not fire on their own people. This is a major test for Biden. He must exert leadership and American influence."" Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had particularly strong words against Cuba's system of government. ""Protests in #Cuba arent simply about 'shortages Socialism promises guaranteed food, medicine & income if you give up your freedom,"" Rubio tweeted. ""When, as always, it fails to deliver you dont get your freedom back."" Cruz spoke out against the ""tyranny"" of the Cuban government, noting that his family fled from the country. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS IGNORE CUBAN PROTESTERS RAILING AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP ""The Cuban people have fought against the tyranny of the Communist regime for decades, and have taken to the streets demanding liberty,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""This regime has brutalized and denied freedom to generations of Cubans, forcing many including my family to flee or be murdered, and over the coming days will widen its violence to try to suppress the brave protesters in the streets."" Meanwhile, self-professed Democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appear to be in lockstep by not acknowledging what is happening in Cuba. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Biden, however, issued a statement supporting the Cuban people for ""bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said.

28,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jul/12/thousands-march-in-cuba-in-rare-mass-protests-amid-economic-crisis,"The biggest mass demonstrations for three decades have rippled through Cuba, as thousands took to the streets in cities throughout the island, demonstrating against food shortages, high prices and communist rule. The protests began in the morning, in the town of San Antonio de los Banos in the west of the island, and in the city of Palma Soriano in the east. In both cases protesters numbered in the hundreds. With millions of Cubans now with mobile internet on their phones, news of the protests quickly swept to Havana. By early afternoon, thousands marched through central Havana, chanting ""homeland and life"" and ""freedom"". ""Im here because of hunger, because theres no medicine, because of power cuts - because theres a lack of everything,"" said a man in his 40s who didnt want to give his name for fear of reprisals. ""I want a total change: a change of government, multiparty elections, and the end of communism."" The protesters were met by uniformed and plainclothes police officers, who bundled hundreds of demonstrators - many of them violent - into police cars. Youths tore up paving slabs and hurled them at police; police used pepper spray and beat protesters with truncheons. One policeman, hit on the head with a cobblestone, was sped away in a car that nearly ran over a protester. With a rock in each hand, Yusniel Perez, 17, said: ""Were here because were hungry and poor. We dont have food. We dont have anything."" At 3pm local time all television channels were interrupted with a broadcast from President Miguel Diaz-Canel who said that ""destabilisation in our country"" would be met with a ""revolutionary response"". ""We call upon all the revolutionaries of the country, all the communists, to take to the streets."" A game of cat and mouse ensued, where young anti-government protesters tried to occupy iconic parts of the capital, only to be blocked off by older government supporters, state security and the army. Aylin Guerrero, 52, was one of thousands who came out to support the government, in central Havana. ""We are the people and we have come out to support our conquests"", she said, surrounded by thousands of government supporters some bearing wooden clubs. ""Even if were not communists, were patriots."" Government supporters accused anti-government protesters of being mercenaries paid by the United States, which spend approximately 20 million dollars a year on ""democracy promotion"" on the island. As evening fell, state forces and supporters had reclaimed the streets. Government supporters gathering at the Maximo Gomez monument in Havana on Sunday.

Cubans are living through the gravest economic crisis the country has known for 30 years. The Trump administration hammered the island with more than 200 new sanctions aimed at sabotaging the islands economy and stirring discontent, measures that have so far been left untouched by the Biden administration. Since the pandemic, which has gutted tourism revenue, Cubans have become accustomed to waiting in line for hours to buy basic goods like chicken and detergent. Pharmacy shelves are barren.

Photograph: Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images The protests were the biggest since 1994, when tens of thousands demonstrated at Havanas Malecon promenade amid an acute economic crisis brought on by the fall of the Soviet Union. An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sundays demonstrations. Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for western hemisphere affairs, tweeted: ""Peaceful protests are growing in Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising Covid cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need.""",['Ed Augustin'],7/12/2021 15:40,Thousands march in Cuba in rare mass protests amid economic crisis,"['havana', 'mass', 'state', 'support', 'amid', 'thousands', 'protests', 'rare', 'cuba', 'island', 'cuban', 'economic', 'country', 'crisis', 'supporters', 'protesters']","The biggest mass demonstrations for three decades have rippled through Cuba, as thousands took to the streets in cities throughout the island, demonstrating against food shortages, high prices and communist rule.

29,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-police-leave-ap-photographer-bloody-after-public-beating/,"Communist Party security forces in Cuba brutally assaulted an Associated Press photographer and several other international journalists attempting to cover protests against the regime on Sunday, leaving them visibly injured. Beginning Sunday morning, thousands of Cubans spontaneously gathered in at least 20 cities across the island to protest the communist regime, waving American flags and chanting ""freedom."" Havana has responded with brutal methods to suppress the demonstrators, using police force and evidently, live rounds, the discharge of which protesters have filmed. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, Raul Castros public figurehead, called for street ""combat"" against the agitators in a bellicose Sunday speech. ""We are willing to give our lives. They will have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution,"" he said. ""The order of combat is issued, revolutionaries to the streets."" Reportedly beginning in San Antonio de los Banos, a town in the islands West, Facebook livestreams of protesters shouting ""down with communism!"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" prompted nationwide outbursts of anti-regime expressions. The regimes violent suppression of the demonstrators has spread to journalists documenting their activities. Associated Press (AP) reporter Ramon Espinosa appeared in graphic photos from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) in which Cuban authorities attempt to restrain Espinosa. He was photographing the Havana protests. Subsequent photos depicted Espinosa, visibly injured, with blood covering his face from his eyes to his chin. Dark lines underscored his left eye and blood trickled from his nostrils, indicating he sustained multiple blows to the head between photos. Faced with considerable police violence, the demonstrators themselves have begun to speak of armed uprising. Following police gunfire in El Cerro, Havana, on Monday morning, an anonymous Cuban youth told ADN Cuba that unarmed demonstrators are helpless against the communist forces -- ""Sin armas somos un pastel para las moscas"" -- ""without weapons, we are a pastry for the flies."" ""We need weapons, something, I dont know,"" he continued. He was nonetheless resolute, saying ""we are going to give it all we have!"" Journalists and eyewitnesses in Camaguey, in Cubas rural center, saw protesters fight back against police gunfire by throwing rocks and overturning police cars.",['Ben Whedon'],7/12/2021 15:57,Cuba: Police Leave AP Photographer Bloody After Public Beating,"['visibly', 'leave', 'weapons', 'bloody', 'communist', 'cuban', 'ap', 'beating', 'regime', 'cuba', 'press', 'photographer', 'espinosa', 'demonstrators', 'public', 'photos', 'protesters']","Communist Party security forces in Cuba brutally assaulted an Associated Press photographer and several other international journalists attempting to cover protests against the regime on Sunday, leaving them visibly injured.

Thousands of Cubans have taken to the streets to lash out at the worsening economic and health conditions under the autocratic leftist government. President Biden released a statement saying the United States stands with the Cuban people and called for the ""Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" CUBANS PROTESTING COMMUNISM WITH AMERICAN FLAG BECAUSE ITS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM: REP GIMENEZ Meanwhile, a few fellow Democrats parroted Cubas communist governments talking points and blamed the U.S. for the suffering of the Cuban people rather than the communist government. Many called on President Biden to end the decades-long embargo on the country. ""The Cuban people suffer doubly from a repressive government and a cruel US embargo. They deserve policies that empower them and help them improve their lives,"" former senior advisor to President Obama and MSNBC contributor Ben Rhodes tweeted. Allen Glines and Shahid Buttar, both Democrats running for Congress, called for an end to the embargo. Buttar went further and added that Cubans ""enjoy"" more rights that Americans are denied like healthcare and housing. California Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna also called for an end to the U.S. embargo but also added that ""Cubas dictatorship must not interfere with peaceful protests."" Progressive reporters from outlets like NPR, Al Jazeera, The Nation, and The New Republic echoed Rhodes sentiment that the U.S. is to blame for poor economic conditions in Cuba. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Critics of the U.S. embargo of Cuba failed to mention that food and medicine are routinely exempted. Julie Chung, now acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, tweeted last year that the U.S. ""routinely authorizes the export of humanitarian goods, agricultural products, medicine, and medical equipment to support the Cuban people.""",['Andrew Kugle'],7/12/2021 16:44,"Reporters, Democrats blame US embargo for protests, poor conditions in Cuba","['running', 'reporters', 'embargo', 'end', 'called', 'states', 'rhodes', 'communist', 'poor', 'conditions', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'blame', 'democrats', 'routinely', 'united']","Some reporters and Democratic candidates running for Congress blamed the United States embargo of Cuba as the reason for the recent protests against the communist regime there.

Protesters said the 62-year-old communist authoritarian political systems inability to deal with the public health and economic crisis has resulted in lives lost. There is a shortage of food, medicines, and COVID-19 vaccines.

Social media users hoped the plea for help from different Cuban cities Sunday would reach the international community. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel responded Monday morning by saying the ""Cuban-American mafia"" had paid ""influencers."" Diaz-Canel didnt mention Lebanese-American Sarah Joe Chamoun, better known as porn star Mia Khalifa, by name. He did say that it appeared like ""a certain artist with certain characteristics"" was ""pressured"" into saying that he was a tyrant. In tweets directed to his account, she hurled insulting expletives at him. Ad ""This government is not afraid. We are full of energy, we are full of enthusiasm although it hurts ... It is hard what we are going through but we are convinced that we are going to face it and we are going to win,"" Diaz-Canel said in Spanish. Witnesses said Cuban police officers in civilian clothes were watching protesters. Some were armed with guns, baseball bats and rocks. Protesters said Cuban authorities also caused internet outages to prevent videos and photos of the historic protests from being distributed around the world.

During the news conference Monday, an official admitted to having challenges with hospital capacity. They report 6,750 coronavirus cases and 31 COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic started.

The difficulties, Diaz-Canel said, came just as the island was feeling the effects of former President Donald Trump's sanctions. Some Cuban officials said during the news conference that enforcing the U.S. embargo during the pandemic is ""genocide."" A public health official touted scientists on the island developed several COVID vaccines including the three-shot Abdala. The Mambisa and the Soberanas vaccines remain under development and there is an ongoing study in Camaguey, a Cuban official said during the news conference. Protesters in Havana didnt share the Cuban government health officials pride. Witnesses videos show there were acts of vandalism against police during the historic demonstration of discontent. Protesters met in front of Cubas Communist Party headquarters where The Associated Press reported officers detained about 20 protesters. Ad Protesters who want democracy in Cuba said they want the freedom to elect a new government and put an end to the one-party system. In turn, government officials asked Cubans who support the communist revolution to go out to the streets and ""fight."" Cuba's people continue to bravely express yearning for freedom in the face of repression. We call on Cuba's govt to: Refrain from violence. Listen to their citizens demands. Respect protestor & journalist rights. The Cuban people have waited long enough for !Libertad! -- Julie Chung (@WHAAsstSecty) July 12, 2021 President Joe Biden released a statement Monday accusing Cuban officials of corruption.

32,https://nypost.com/2021/07/12/democrats-and-republicans-divided-on-cuban-protest-response/,"The Biden administration and other prominent Democrats have been slow to respond to the ongoing protests against Cubas communist regime, while Republican politicians - many of them based in Florida - have sent messages of solidarity to the demonstrators. In a statement issued Monday, 24 hours after protesters first took to the streets, the White House said it supported ""the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" the statement read. ""Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" However, as images of the unrest were carried around the world on social media Sunday, the only statement from an administration official came via a tweet from Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Julie Chung. ""Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages,"" wrote Chung, who made no mention of the islands totalitarian government. ""We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki seemed to waffle Monday on the question of whether the protests were related to immediate events or if they reflected longstanding anger. ""There is every indication that yesterdays protests were spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban governments economic mismanagement and repression and these are protests inspired by the harsh reality of everyday life in Cuba,"" she said. Psaki declined to give a direct response when asked whether the Biden administration supports protesters using the American flag as a symbol of their struggle for freedom, saying only that ""the president certainly respects the symbol of the American flag"" and adding that while Biden displays it at his home, he ""also believes people have the right to peaceful protest."" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the son of Cuban immigrants, did issue a statement of his own Sunday that trumpeted a ""historic day of protests"". ""For decades, Cubas dictatorship has used violence and repression to silence its people, rather than permit the free exercise of democracy and their basic social rights,"" Menendez wrote. ""This must end. The worlds eyes are on Cuba tonight and the dictatorship must understand we will not tolerate the use of brute force to silence the aspirations of the Cuban people. ""As Ive said over the years, no one wishes that the reality in Cuba was more different than the Cuban people and Cuban-Americans that have fled the island in search of freedom,"" the senator added. ""Let us hear their voices. Listen to their cries of desperation. Support their demands by ensuring we do not perpetuate the regimes decades of repression."" Cuban demonstrators in Madrid, Spain, protest outside the Spanish lower chamber to ask the Cuban government to ""not violently suppress the peaceful rallies in Cuba."" FERNANDO VILLAR/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), tweeted her support for the Cuban protesters Monday, saying: ""The call for freedom and basic rights by the people of Cuba peacefully taking to the streets and marching is an act of great courage. I support the Cuban people in their pursuit of liberty and condemn any violence or targeting of those exercising their rights."" Two of the most prominent socialist members of Congress, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), had yet to make any comment on the situation as of Monday afternoon. Sanders caused outrage while running for president in February of 2020 when he told ""60 Minutes"" that it was ""unfair to simply say everything is bad"" about the Cuban regime. ""When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program,"" Sanders said. ""Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?"" Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday that ""I stand with the Cuban people 100% in their fight for freedom. ""The Government must let them speak and be free!"" Trump added. ""Joe Biden MUST stand up to the Communist regime or--history will remember. The Cuban people deserve freedom and human rights! THEY ARE NOT AFRAID! Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that ""people in Cuba are protesting 62 years of socialism lies, tyranny and misery, not 'expressing concerns about...COVID.'"" REUTERS The 45th president also said that ""Biden and the Democrats campaigned on reversing my very tough stance on Cuba. Remember when Obama attended baseball games with Castros while they imprisoned, beat, and killed the Cuban people."" Other Republican lawmakers spend Sunday cheering on the protesters and criticizing the Biden administrations relative silence. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) blasted Chungs statement as ""ridiculous."" ""People in #Cuba are protesting 62 years of socialism, lies, tyranny & misery not expressing concern about rising COVID cases/deaths,"" he tweeted. ""Why is it so hard for [Biden] & the people in his administration to say that?"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), also put Chung on blast. ""No theyre chanting LIBERTAD,"" he said. ""Stop playing cover for communists and support the Cuban people. My god. Why is that so hard for you?"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, reacting to massive anti-Havana demonstrations in that city, tweeted that ""I have never felt such raw emotion from the people of Miami desperate for intervention by the government and by themselves on behalf of Cuba. This is the moment for freedom in Cuba. IT CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER!"" In an earlier tweet, Suarez posted an image of himself speaking at one of the Miami demonstrations and added: ""The Cuban regimes military police are shooting at unarmed Cuban protestors fighting for freedom. 60 years of communism, cruelty, & oppression cannot last any longer! We are imploring the USA to take action as we peacefully demonstrate on the streets of Miami."" Suarez added the hashtag ""PATRIAYVIDA"" (""Homeland and life""), the rallying cry of the protesters Government supporters gather at the Maximo Gomez monument in Havana, Cuba, during a counter-protest. AP ""The United States needs to stand firm with the brave Cuban people as they protest the Castro regime and its years of oppression and communism,"" Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) told the Post. ""Instead of ignorantly blaming the protests on COVID as some Administration officials have, Joe Biden needs to be vocal in support and take action as they fight for freedom, opportunity and liberty."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) tweeted: ""After decades of suffering through a communist dictatorship, the Cuban people deserve liberty. I am proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Cuba who are calling out for freedom."" Cuba President Miguel Diaz-Canel alleged Monday that the protests were stirred up on social media by Cuban-Americans in the US. As of Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram in an apparent response to the protest, according to Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba has the ability to cut it off if it wants to.

33,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-slams-bidens-initial-comments-blaming-cuba-protests-on-covid-cases-as-a-major-failure,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is criticizing President Bidens administration for its initial diagnosis on the causes of mass protests that broke out in Cuba on Sunday. In a statement provided to Fox News, Rubio said more than 60 years of ""socialist dictatorship and oppression, as well as extraordinary courage from the Cuban people, have led to this historic moment."" His message was at odds with the State Department, which initially tied the historic protests in Cuba to COVID-19 concerns rather than the countrys communist government. Rubio slammed that charge - as well as the presidents silence over the weekend - as a ""major failure."" ""Now more than ever, the Cuban people need our support as they fight for their freedom,"" Rubio said. SANDERS LOVES TRASHING REPUBLICANS BUT WON'T CONDEMN TRULY OPPRESSIVE CUBAN COMMUNISTS Fox News reached out to the State Department which referred to a statement by President Biden on Monday praising Cuban protesters for issuing a ""clarion call for freedom and relief"" and called on the Cuban government to allow for peaceful protests. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" the president continued, adding that those rights, ""including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected."" ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves,"" Biden said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, meanwhile, sought to frame the protests being driven by far broader frustration, calling the demonstrations ""spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban governments economic mismanagement and repression."" DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS IGNORE CUBAN PROTESTERS RAILING AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP She added that the U.S. remains ready to assist Cuba in its COVID-19 vaccination effort, but the Cuban governments decision not to participate in COVAX - a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to poorer nations - complicated the effort. ""We certainly recognize and understand that access to vaccines is one of the issues that a number of individuals on the streets is voicing concern about, but we have to determine what the mechanism would be to work with the Cuban people to get vaccines to them,"" Psaki said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Later Monday, Rubio sent Biden a letter saying that the current protests in Cuba ""are not just about current economic shortages"" but about ""longstanding and deliberate actions taken by the dictatorship to stymy the economic prosperity and political freedom of the Cuban people."" In his letter, Rubio provided President Biden with six steps his administration ought to take to support the Cuban people.

34,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/12/cuba-protests-economic-crisis-president-miguel-diaz-canel,"The Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has attacked the ""shameful delinquents"" he claimed were trying to ""fracture"" his countrys communist revolution after the Caribbean island witnessed its largest anti-government protests in nearly three decades. As Cuban officials blamed the US for Sundays demonstrations, Joe Biden called on the islands leaders to hear its citizens ""clarion call for freedom"". ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" Biden said in a statement. In a televised address on Monday morning Diaz-Canel, who recently succeeded Raul Castro as the Communist partys top figure, painted the protests as part of a United States-backed, social media-driven plot to stir up public discontent and overthrow the Cuban regime. ""The approach wasnt peaceful yesterday,"" the 61-year-old politician claimed, criticising the ""completely vulgar"" behaviour of some demonstrators who he accused of throwing rocks at police and destroying cars. Diaz-Canel conceded other protesters had legitimate concerns over food shortages and blackouts, although he blamed those problems on US sanctions. ""Its legitimate to feel dissatisfaction,"" the partys powerful first secretary said in the broadcast. Rogelio Polanco Fuentes, a top party official who runs its ideology department, denounced the protests as part of a well-funded US-sponsored effort to create ""instability and chaos"" in Cuba, which is currently experiencing its worst economic slump in decades as well as a worsening Covid crisis. Polanco Fuentes compared Sundays protests to the failed US-backed uprising against Venezuelas authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, in 2019. ""We are living through new chapters of the non-conventional war ... in other places they have called these Colour Revolutions ... or soft coups,"" Polanco said. Cuban dissidents rejected those claims about the protests which rippled across Cuba on Sunday, with thousands taking to the streets to denounce the lack of medicine and food and the lack of political freedoms. By Sunday afternoon the demonstrations had reached one of Cubas most iconic locations: the seafront Malecon in the capital Havana where thousands of protesters were seen chanting ""homeland and life"" and ""freedom"". The Malecon promenade was the setting of Cubas last significant street demonstrations, a sudden and short-lived explosion of dissent in 1994 known as the ""Maleconazo Uprising"". ""What is happening is absolutely historical for us ... I think this is a point of no return. Things will never be there same after this,"" said Carolina Barrero, a 34-year-old Havana-based activist. ""We are talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of people, all across the island. In every little town there was protest, [it was] completely spontaneous. ""They were shouting: 'We dont have fear any more! 'We want freedom! and 'Abajo la dictadura! (Down with the dictatorship!)"" added Barrero, an art historian who said she had recently been placed under house arrest after being detained reading a poem outside Cubas culture ministry. Paul Hare, the former British ambassador in Havana, said Cubas leaders would be concerned by the highly unusual eruption of dissent, and particularly how it had been organized with the help of social media. Word of the protests spread rapidly on Sunday, as celebrities and influencers shared news of the marches using the hashtag #SOSCuba. ""What Cubas government has always dreaded is a coordinated movement, as opposed to sporadic protests ... They see it as the possible genesis of an organized rival political movement,"" Hare said. ""The hardliners will be saying: 'Be careful - this could get out of hand ... They will be worried [about the protests]. It is a sign that the Communist party is no longer able to vertically dictate what policy should be,"" Hare added. Cuban activists said they were unimpressed with Diaz-Canels initial response to their demands, and particularly his call on Sunday for ""revolutionaries"" to hit the streets to confront protesters provocations ""with firmness and bravery"". ""What worries me the most is how they are trying to lay the ground for a wave of repression,"" said Claudia Genlui Hidalgo, a 30-year-old dissident who saw several friends arrested on Sunday. ""When he says 'revolutionaries to the street, hes inciting violence."" Barrero said she hoped the protests would lead to a peaceful transition away from one-party rule but was also troubled by the possibility of conflict and by Diaz-Canels description of the protests as ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"". Hare predicted there would now be a political crackdown on those identified as protest ringleaders as Communist party security chiefs fought to prevent a repeat. World leaders reacted to Cubas unexpected convulsion on Monday with Mexicos president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, saying he hoped a peaceful resolution could be reached ""without the use of force, without confrontation and without violence"". ""The Cubans must decide [the solution] because Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation - there must be no interventionism,"" Lopez Obrador added. A spokesperson for Russias foreign ministry also cautioned against ""outside interference"" that sought to ""encourage the destabilization"" of the communist-run island.","['Tom Phillips', 'Ed Augustin']",7/12/2021 17:45,Cuban president claims protests part of US plot to 'fracture' Communist party,"['party', 'peaceful', 'president', 'leaders', 'claims', 'communist', 'cuban', 'thousands', 'protests', 'cubas', 'fracture', 'political', 'protesters', 'plot']","The Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has attacked the ""shameful delinquents"" he claimed were trying to ""fracture"" his countrys communist revolution after the Caribbean island witnessed its largest anti-government protests in nearly three decades.

35,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-backs-cuban-protests-islands-president-blames-imperialist/story?id=78798057,"President Joe Biden on Monday stood in solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who protested over the weekend about shortages and rising prices for food and medicine amid the coronavirus pandemic in what's being called an unprecedented rejection of the island nation's government. Biden, speaking to reporters at a White House meeting Monday, addressed what he called ""the remarkable protests"" in Cuba of people ""demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime."" ""And I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- if, quite frankly, ever. And the United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights, and we call on the government, the government of Cuba, to refrain from violence and their attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba,"" he said. Cuba's communist leadership has already denounced the protests as a ""systemic provocation"" by Cuban dissidents and the U.S. government, encouraged its supporters to counter-protest, and sent its armed forces into the streets, risking clashes with demonstrators. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden said, ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime."" ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves,"" he said. Sunday's protests, in several cities across the island, are some of the biggest anti-government demonstrations in Cuba's recent history, and Biden had been called on to show support for the protests. While he helped the Obama administration's efforts to ease tensions with Cuba and reopen trade and travel, Biden has kept most of former President Donald Trump's sanctions and restrictions in place on America's close neighbor and longtime adversary. The administration says it is still reviewing its Cuba policy, earning the ire of progressives in the Democratic Party, but with these nearly unprecedented demonstrations, it may have to move more quickly than it hoped. So far, the administration has voiced support for the Cuban people's right to peacefully assemble and condemned any violence. Prior to Biden's statement, acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Julie Chung and Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan weighed in with that sentiment. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged public grievances over blackouts and food and medicine shortages during a televised address Monday, but he blamed the island nation's problems on the long-standing U.S. embargo and accused American ""imperialists"" of stoking tensions on social media. ""Yesterday, Cuba lived the most heroic day. Thousands of patriotic people defend the Revolution,"" he said on state television, referring to pro-government demonstrations in Havana later on Sunday that numbered around 300, according to the Associated Press. ""We do not want to hurt our beloved people,"" added Diaz-Canel, who assumed the presidency in 2019 and became the first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party this April, officially taking over for Raul Castro. Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla had even sharper words Monday, firing back at Sullivan and Chung's statements of support for protests by saying the White House has ""no political or moral authority to speak about Cuba."" ""His government has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to promote subversion in our country & implements a genocidal blockade, which is the main cause of economic scarcities,"" he tweeted, referring directly to Sullivan's statement. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, with its economy contracting by double-digits last year. But along with the economic crisis, the country is dealing with another deadly surge of COVID-19. ABC News' Christine Theodorou and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.","['Abc News', 'Conor Finnegan', 'July']",7/12/2021 18:22,Biden backs Cuban protests as island's president blames 'imperialist' provocations,"['president', 'rights', 'islands', 'right', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'imperialist', 'economic', 'provocations', 'backs', 'blames']","Biden, speaking to reporters at a White House meeting Monday, addressed what he called ""the remarkable protests"" in Cuba of people ""demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime.""

Suarez, whose father Xavier was the city's first Cuban-born mayor, told ""Your World"" guest host Sandra Smith on Monday that it is unbelievable that anyone would fail to condemn Communist ideology. ""[It] has failed not just in Cuba but in the history of humanity--this is an ideology that promises to create equality. The only equality it has delivered is equal misery for all of its citizens in every country that its been tried,"" he said. ""It's time for the United States to understand that. It's time for us to understand this could affect American cities if we're not careful."" Suarez added that socialism provides people a ""false promise"" and in practice means the government takes away peoples' property and freedoms. ""The truth of the matter is, it's never worked and never going to work and the United States has to start intervening and finding a way, whether it's through humanitarian aid, military intervention, whatever means necessary to protect the sovereignty of the Cuban people and the sovereignty of the United States in this hemisphere,"" he said. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, who is also head of the Communist Party, released a statement that warned the ""Cuban Revolution is not going to turn the other cheek to those who attack it in virtual and real spaces,"" and that his government will ""avoid revolutionary violence, but will repress counterrevolutionary violence."" Suarez said the communist regime is a ""drug-trafficking dictatorship"" that sponsors terrorism and exports its dangerous political system throughout the world. ""And so, it affects U.S. interests. That's something that sometimes is not emphasized enough: How this affects U.S. National security policy,"" he said. ""And I think the U.S. has to understand that these kinds of regimes that are enslaving not just Cubans, but Nicaraguans and Venezuelans... impact our sovereignty and our security."" ""The U.S. has a vested interest and a right to intervene on behalf of the Cuban people but also on behalf of the United States and creating an international coalition is important,"" he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mayor referenced Fox News correspondent Phil Keating's report outside Versailles, a famous Cuban restaurant on US-41 in Little Havana, where people waved Cuban flags and shouted pro-democracy slogans. ""The Cuban people have no food, as was stated by [Keating]. They have no access to medical care, particularly being devastated by the coronavirus and most importantly they want freedom. What we have in this country, they want the hope for a better future,"" Suarez said.",['Charles Creitz'],7/12/2021 18:30,"Miami mayor blasts far-left silence on Cuban protests, says crisis exposes fallacy of socialism","['farleft', 'states', 'socialism', 'told', 'communist', 'fox', 'cuban', 'crisis', 'protests', 'suarez', 'exposes', 'understand', 'united', 'silence', 'miami', 'mayor', 'fallacy', 'sovereignty']","Miami Republican Mayor Francis Suarez called out the far-left's silence over the pro-democracy protests in Cuba, which has been ruled by decades of Communist dictatorship, and told Fox News the latest unrest exposes the ""false promise"" of socialism.

37,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/12/desantis-derangement-democrats-condemn-florida-governor-cuba-protests/,"Florida Democrats responded to Governor Ron DeSantis (R) sending support to anti-communist protesters in Cuba on Sunday by attacking the governor, seemingly comparing his administration to the Castro regime. The Republican Partys rising star posted on Twitter sharing a video of the protests, which took place throughout the island and news outlets estimate attracted thousands of people: Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana. The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies #SOSCuba Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana. The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies#SOSCuba pic.twitter.com/H71EYoKdUZ -- Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) July 11, 2021 Democrats largely responded by criticizing DeSantis for the anti-riot bill he signed into law in April, which increases penalties for people who participate in unruly protests. DeSantis passed the bill in response to Black Lives Matter protests that devolved into violence and looting in major cities across the nation last summer. Notably, Black Lives Matter was founded by ""trained Marxists."" Marxism is the philosophical underpinning of communism, the ruling political system in Cuba, and has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people over several decades, as Breitbart News reported. Unlike the Cuba protests on Sunday, the assemblies the DeSantis bill targets would involve violence on the part of participants, including vandalism, looting, and property destruction. Democrats appear to argue that DeSantis was being hypocritical by supporting peaceful protesters in Cuba while attempting to crack down on violent riots in the United States. ""Says the Governor who pushed through House Bill 1, a bill motivated as a means to silence racial justice protests,"" State Rep. Anna V. Eskamani (D) tweeted. ""I support the Cuban people as they take to the streets & let their voices be heard & do everything they cant do in Florida without it being labelled [sic] an 'aggravated riot under Ron Desantiss anti-protest law,"" State Rep. Omari Hardy (D) wrote. ""@GovRonDeSantis made this type of protest illegal in Florida. He wants to silence dissent because he fears accountability,"" tweeted Steve Simeonidis, who is the chair for Miami-Dade Democrats. In response to Simeonidis, Republican communicator and former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications deputy Matt Whitlock criticized Democrats rhetoric. He tweeted: Fascinating strategy from a number of Florida Dems. Instead of supporting protestors in Cuba, theyre trying to argue DeSantiss anti-rioting law wouldve prevented similar protests. It wouldnt have, but a good window into why theyre losing the voters theyre losing. Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) also re-tweeted DeSantis in support of Cuban protesters and warned of communisms insidious grasp in the United States. He posted: The same Communist rule the people of Cuba are valiantly protesting as we speak is the same Communism threatening to take hold in America today. May God protect the brave people protesting the tyrannical Cuban regime. May their long-awaited freedom prevail once & for all. President Joe Biden released a statement on Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people"" against their repressive communist regime. However, he failed to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security, Breitbart News reported. He also failed to condemn socialism and communism. The leftist New York Times, which played a direct role in Fidel Castros takeover of Cuba, also erroneously reported the protests were about ""food and medicine shortages,"" even though local independent outlets documented protesters chanting ""down with communism!"", ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"", among other anti-government statements. The protests appeared to begin in the town of San Antonio de los Banos, western Cuba, on Sunday morning. Locals livestreamed the protest on Facebook, triggering an outpouring into the streets of at least 16 major cities including both Havana and Santiago de Cuba, on opposite ends of the island, Breitbart News reported. So far, local outlets in Cuba are estimating hundreds of arrests. Bystanders recorded the sound of heavy gunfire in Havana and public beatings of dissidents. Miguel Diaz-Canel, the 'president appointed by Raul Castro, called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime in a speech on Sunday.",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/12/2021 18:47,Florida Democrats Condemn DeSantis over Cuba Protests,"['streets', 'havana', 'desantis', 'florida', 'cuban', 'regime', 'protests', 'cuba', 'democrats', 'condemn', 'silence', 'bill', 'protesters']","Florida Democrats responded to Governor Ron DeSantis (R) sending support to anti-communist protesters in Cuba on Sunday by attacking the governor, seemingly comparing his administration to the Castro regime. DeSantis passed the bill in response to Black Lives Matter protests that devolved into violence and looting in major cities across the nation last summer. Unlike the Cuba protests on Sunday, the assemblies the DeSantis bill targets would involve violence on the part of participants, including vandalism, looting, and property destruction. Democrats appear to argue that DeSantis was being hypocritical by supporting peaceful protesters in Cuba while attempting to crack down on violent riots in the United States. Rep.

(AP Photo/Eliana Aponte, file) Cubans facing the countrys worst economic crisis in decades took to the streets over the weekend. In turn, authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation. Restricting internet access has become a tried-and-true method of stifling dissent by authoritarian regimes around the world, alongside government-supported disinformation campaigns and propaganda. On the extreme side, regimes like China and North Korea exert tight control over what regular citizens can access online. Elsewhere, service blockages are more limited, often cutting off common social platforms around elections and times of mass protests. There was no formal organizer of Sundays protests; people found out about the rallying points over social media, mostly on Twitter and Facebook, the platforms most used by Cubans. The thousands of Cubans who took to the streets -- protesters and pro-government activists alike -- wielded smartphones to capture images and send them to relatives and friends or post them online. ADVERTISEMENT On Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, said Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm. ""This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,"" he said. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba could cut it off if it wants to. While the recent easing of access by Cuban authorities to the internet has increased social media activity, Toker said, the level of censorship has also risen. Not only does the cutoff block out external voices, he said, it also squelches ""the internal voice of the population who have wanted to speak out."" Internet access in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. The country was ""basically offline"" until 2008, then gradually entered a digital revolution, said Ted Henken, a Latin America expert at Baruch College, City University of New York. The biggest change, he noted, came in December 2018 when Cubans got access to mobile internet for the first time via data plans purchased from the state telecom monopoly. These days, more than half of all Cubans have internet access, Henken said. Many Cubans now have real-time, anywhere-you-are access to the internet and the ability to share information among themselves, he added. Since early 2019, this access has facilitated regular, if smaller, events and protests on the island. In response, the government has periodically shut down access to social media, mostly to hide its repressive tactics from both citizens and foreigners, he said. The Cuban government also restricts independent media in Cuba and ""routinely blocks access within Cuba to many news websites and blogs,"" according to Human Rights Watch. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. The protests now, the largest in decades, are ""absolutely and definitely fueled by increased access to internet and smartphones in Cuba,"" said Sebastian Arcos, associate director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. ADVERTISEMENT Social media posts from within and outside of Cuba are ""not the root causes of the rebellion, but they are a factor in connecting the desperation, disaffection that exists in the island,"" said Arturo Lopez-Levy, an assistant political science professor at Holy Names University in California. Lopez-Levy, who grew up a few blocks from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, said the countrys current leader has embraced the economic potential of digital technology far more than his predecessors, but may have calculated that a large segment of Cubans will accept a temporary internet shutdown if it helps restore order in the streets. Elsewhere, government internet shutdowns after or ahead of protests have also become commonplace, whether for a few hours or extending for months. In Ethiopia, there was a three-week shutdown in July 2020 after civil unrest. The internet blackout in the Tigray region has stretched on for months. In Belarus, the internet went down for more than two days after an August 2020 election seen as rigged sparked mass protests. Mobile internet service repeatedly went down during weekend protests for months afterwards. A decade ago during the Arab Spring, when social media was still in its early years and Egypt, Tunisia and other countries in the Middle East faced bloody uprisings that were broadcast on social media, headlines declared the movements ""Twitter Revolutions"" and experts debated about just how important a role social media played in the events. Ten years later, there is no question that social media and private chat platforms have become an essential organizing tool. Restricting them, in turn, is a routine move to suppress dissent. Internet service was disrupted in Cali, Colombia during May anti-government protests. This year has also seen disruptions in Armenia, Uganda, Iran, Chad, Senegal and the Republic of Congo. But authoritarian regimes arent the only ones getting into the act. India routinely shuts down the internet during times of unrest. Toker of NetBlocks said the imposition of internet restrictions in Cuba follows an emerging global pattern and not always in the countries you most expect them, such as a recent Nigerian cutoff of Twitter. On the plus side, he said, the world is much more aware of these incidents because its easier to monitor and report them remotely. On Sunday, all of Cuba went offline for less than 30 minutes, after which there were several hours of intermittent but large outages, said Doug Madory of Kentik, a network management company. He said large internet outages were very rare in Cuba until very recently. ""There was an outage in January just for mobile service following the '27N protests,"" Madory said, referring to a movement of Cuban artists, journalists and other members of civil society who marched on the Ministry of Culture on Nov. 27, 2020, demanding freedom and democracy. Henken said he doesnt believe the government would shut off access for an extended period of time, even though that is its go-to tactic for dissidents and activists. ""The problem they have now is that its not a handful of activists or artists or independent journalists -- its now a massive swath of the population all throughout the country,"" he said. ""So the genie is out of the bottle. Theyre trying to put it back in."" __ AP Havana correspondent Andrea Rodriguez and AP technology reporter Matt OBrien contributed to this article.","['Barbara Ortutay', 'Frank Bajak', 'Tali Arbel']",7/12/2021 19:15,Cuba's internet cutoff: A go-to tactic to suppress dissent,"['cutoff', 'media', 'decades', 'access', 'tactic', 'economic', 'cuban', 'dissent', 'internet', 'protests', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'social', 'cubas', 'goto', 'suppress']","In turn, authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation. Restricting internet access has become a tried-and-true method of stifling dissent by authoritarian regimes around the world, alongside government-supported disinformation campaigns and propaganda. These days, more than half of all Cubans have internet access, Henken said. A decade ago during the Arab Spring, when social media was still in its early years and Egypt, Tunisia and other countries in the Middle East faced bloody uprisings that were broadcast on social media, headlines declared the movements ""Twitter Revolutions"" and experts debated about just how important a role social media played in the events. Ten years later, there is no question that social media and private chat platforms have become an essential organizing tool.",apnews.com,Center,7457,"[ 2.15942990e-02  7.96362851e-03  1.36047117e-02  1.39644090e-02

40,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/politics/biden-foreign-policy-cuba-haiti/index.html,"(CNN) President Joe Biden has staked his presidency on America's return -- a return to normalcy amid the coronavirus pandemic , a return to the global stage following four years of Trump-era isolationism and, arguably, a return to many of the policy positions adopted by the Obama administration. But recent incidents in the Caribbean mark a moment in which the Biden administration may be in uncharted territory. While issues related to Russia, China and the Northern Triangle have been at the forefront of the Biden administration's foreign policy priorities, violence and demonstrations taking place just off of America's coast have forced the White House's response. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was killed during an attack last week on his private residence in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's first lady, Martine Moise, was also shot in the attack and evacuated to a hospital in Miami for treatment. The assassination has left the nation in deeper turmoil, leaving a power vacuum and coming as Haiti has been dealing with a wave of extreme violence, a growing humanitarian crisis and a worsening Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. The dual crises come at a time when the President would rather be focusing his attention on domestic issues like infrastructure and voting rights, a subject on which he's set to give a major speech on Tuesday. When it comes to foreign affairs the White House has been preoccupied with the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and resetting American foreign policy to focus on powers in the Eastern Hemisphere like Russia and China. To a certain extent, the dealings with those nations are ones that previous administrations also had to figure out how to handle, but the issues bubbling up in the Caribbean will be among the first unique foreign crises to test Biden and his team. Biden on Monday indicated that the US is ""ready to provide assistance"" to both Cuba and Haiti, but it's unclear exactly what form that help will take. The Haitian government last week requested US troops to help protect infrastructure, ports, airports and energy systems, Elections Minister Mathias Pierre told CNN. Mathias said the request was for a limited number of around 500 troops and that he anticipated the threat to be ""potential mercenaries."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that request is still under review. A US delegation traveled to Haiti on Sunday at the Haitian government's request and that delegation briefed Biden on Monday morning after their return. The State Department disclosed Monday that they are aware of a third American citizen detained in Haiti after the assassination. CNN reported Monday evening that several of the men involved in the operation that killed Moise previously worked as informants for US law enforcement, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, another complication for the US response. Psaki said the US is assessing how the country can directly aid the Cuban people. She said it is too early to predict any potential policy change when it comes to Cuba. So far, that has come in statements encouraging the Cuban regime to listen to the protesters and words of support for the people of Cuba. Biden expressed support for the Cuban people on Monday, calling on Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel's regime to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""Folks, I want to start recognizing remarkable protests taking place in Cuba,"" Biden said when speaking to reporters at the White House. ""I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- quite frankly, ever."" Biden said the Cuban people ""are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime,"" and asserting ""their universal rights."" He also warned the Cuban government against ""attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba."" But earlier this spring, Psaki indicated that Cuba was not among the administration's top policy priorities. ""A Cuba policy shift or additional steps is currently not among the President's top foreign policy priorities. But it is an issue, of course, we will remain engaged in and focused on,"" Psaki told reporters in April. Pressed on whether the weekend events in Cuba have changed the administration's priorities, Psaki said on Monday, ""We will be looking to provide support to the people of Cuba. We certainly, you know, support the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of -- when we believe they deserve to have access to the economic support and medical support, health supplies that many of them are asking for."" In nationally televised remarks Sunday, Diaz-Canel placed blame for the economic conditions on sanctions from the US. Under the Obama administration, Cuba oversaw the reopening of embassies and relaxing of many restrictions long in place since the embargo. But the Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, reinstated travel restrictions and before leaving office, named Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism The Biden administration has yet to take action, but the review of Trump's restrictive Cuba policy is still underway, a senior administration official tells CNN. Several months after taking office, Biden has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor's policies and ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Barack Obama. An administration official confirmed there are no changes on the horizon as the policy is still under review. Cuba's actions haven't exactly encouraged the administration to move quickly to change policy. The country has continued to support oppressive Latin American regimes and crackdown on dissidents. Brain injuries that have appeared to target Americans diplomats abroad have also included many originating in Cuba, leading to the name ""Havana Syndrome."" One major voice of opposition to returning to Obama-era Cuba policies is New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who told CNN he's offered a list of policy recommendations to the White House. Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday why Biden had not yet taken action to lift the Trump policies on Cuba, Menendez said on ""The Lead,"" ""I think the President has had time to review the actual policies under President Obama and all of the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided -- unilateral in terms of concessions -- showed themselves to create absolutely no change inside of Cuba."" ""The regime enriched itself. The Cuban people never saw any benefit from it. So the result of that, I think, is that the Biden administration looked and said, 'Wait a minute -- that didn't seem to work. We have to think about what exactly we should do in this regard,' "" Menendez continued.",['Maegan Vazquez'],7/13/2021 4:02,Biden forced to pivot foreign policy focus to crises in neighboring nations,"['president', 'policy', 'crises', 'pivot', 'nations', 'white', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'foreign', 'neighboring', 'cuba', 'forced', 'focus', 'return', 'administration', 'obama']","But recent incidents in the Caribbean mark a moment in which the Biden administration may be in uncharted territory.

From Jacksonville to Tampa and Miami, hundreds of community members took to the streets on Monday to rally for Cuban freedom. CRUZ CALLS OUT BIDEN'S STATE DEPARTMENT AMID REPORTS OF CUBA'S CRACKDOWN ON PROTESTERS ""To me, what it means is a possible end to an oppression,"" Peter Merlo, a demonstrator in Miami, told WSVN-TV. ""We dont need to stand with Cuba. We need to act for Cuba."" Cuban citizens assembled in several cities and towns over the weekend in a rare outpouring of protests over the countrys high prices, food shortages and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Cuban police were out in force on the country's streets as President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Cuban Americans of using social media to fuel the protests. Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon Sunday. In Jacksonville, Fla., demonstrator Eduardo Ramos told local news station WJXT-TV that the Cuban people ""dont have any voice"" under Diaz-Canels regime. ""We dont have access to hospitals, food, medicine, anything,"" Ramos said. ""And people are dying in the street right now."" Demonstrators in Tampa echoed Ramos sentiments. ""The longer we wait the more people will die,"" Daniela Tamayo told WFTS-TV. ""The longer that America waits to intervene the more people will die."" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez joined demonstrators in calling for U.S. intervention in Cuba. ""The Cuban regimes military police are shooting at unarmed Cuban protestors fighting for freedom,"" Suarez tweeted Sunday. ""60 years of communism, cruelty, & oppression cannot last any longer! We are imploring the USA to take action as we peacefully demonstrate on the streets of Miami."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a statement Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden said Cuban protesters were asserting their basic rights. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime,'' Biden said. The U.S. urges the Cuban government to serve their people 'rather than enriching themselves,'' Biden added.

(Pedro Portal/Miami Herald via AP) MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators expressing solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who waged a rare weekend of protests around their island nation shut down a stretch of a major South Florida expressway Tuesday. The large group gathered at a busy Miami intersection chanting support for the Cubans, who had taken to the streets in the communist nation Sunday to air grievances about poor economic conditions and other complaints. A few miles (kilometers) away, hundreds of supporters gathered for hours Tuesday evening at a park. The peaceful crowd waved flags and cheered on the efforts of island protesters. ADVERTISEMENT Flavia Perez, 16, was brought to the U.S. at age 1. She joined the rally at Tamiami Park, saying, ""Im here to support young Cubans on the island so they have the same opportunities as I have in the U.S."" South Florida is home to the largest U.S. population of Cuban Americans. News helicopter footage from broadcaster WTVJ showed demonstrators earlier Tuesday marching to Miamis Palmetto Expressway, where many blocked traffic in the afternoon. Elsewhere, Floridas Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis held a round table with elected officials, including members of Congress. The gathering at Miamis American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora was closed to reporters, but the governor later asserted that protests in Cuba were more than just about shortages of vaccines, food and other basic items. ""They are revolting against a corrupt communist dictatorship that has ruled that island with an iron fist for over 60 years, that is responsible for death and destruction, not just on the island of Cuba but really throughout the Western Hemisphere,"" DeSantis said at a news conference. He said the demonstrators desire ""a free society."" Nationwide protests last year under the Black Lives Matter movement drew attention to racial injustice in the U.S. after the killings of Black people by police. Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into Florida law a measure that enhances penalties against protestors who turn violent and allows criminal penalties against those who organize protests that turn violent. DeSantis dismissed similarities between Black Lives Matter and Tuesdays demonstrators. ""These are people that are rebelling against a communist dictatorship,"" the governor said. He said the demonstrations in Miami were ""fundamentally different than what we saw last summer."" DeSantis, who is said to be considering a run for the White House in 2024, declined a direct response when asked how Democratic President Joe Bidens administration should handle Cuba policy. But he said federal officials shouldnt be satisfied with small Cuban government accommodations designed to quell demonstrations. ADVERTISEMENT Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, the daughter of Cuban exiles, said the community needs to speak with one voice urging the Biden administration to stand tough against the Cuban government. ""We cannot negotiate with the regime at this hour,"" Salazar said. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami has been monitoring for any ""unsafe and illegal"" crossings between Florida and Cuba in response to rare street protests on the island. Rear Adm. Eric C. Jones issued a warning statement Monday night as groups of Cuban immigrants said they planned to travel in boats filled with supplies to Cuba to show support for the Cuban protesters. In Miami, Cuban social media personalities posted Monday that they would make the 10-hour boat ride to Cuba to show support after rare street protests broke out over the weekend, the Miami Herald reported . The influencers said they would bring aid -- and guns -- and urged people in Miami to offer up their boats. One group gathered Monday night at a marina and people brought cases of bottled water, flashlights and boxes of canned pasta, the newspaper reported. ""Water, food, medicine, whatever we can take to Cuba. Whatever we can take to help is good,"" organizer Dennis Suayero told WSVN . The group didnt get very far Monday night. A message posted on organizer Santiago Riveras Instagram account early Tuesday said the Coast Guard stopped his group from traveling. Over the weekend, thousands of Cuban Americans gathered in Miamis Little Havana in support of Cuban street marches against high prices and food shortages on the island. Such unsanctioned protests are extremely rare, and Cuban police were out in force Monday to control them. The last such demonstrations in Havana took place in 1994. President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Cuban Americans of using social media to egg them on. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez , a Cuban American, tweeted that he has never ""felt such raw emotion from the people of Miami desperate for intervention by the government and by themselves on behalf of Cuba."" Miami wasnt the only Florida city where demonstrators gathered. For a second day, Cuban-Americans in Tampa gathered Tuesday at an intersection, blocking traffic and waving Cuban flags. Like the group in South Florida, Tampa demonstrators attempted to gain access to Interstate 275, but police held them back. Television images showed dozens of protesters in a city that traces its Cuban heritage back generations. Orlando also had hundreds of protestors blocking a busy street for about an hour Tuesday evening.","['Bobcaina Calvan', 'Marta Lavandier']",7/13/2021 12:58,Miami demonstrators block highway to support Cuban protests,"['florida', 'support', 'cuban', 'miami', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'rare', 'gathered', 'highway', 'demonstrators', 'block']","Cuban exiles block the Palmetto Expressway at Coral Way in support of protesters in Cuba Tuesday 13, 2021 in Miami.

43,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/politics/biden-cuba-review/index.html,"Several months after taking office, Biden has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor's policies and ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Barack Obama. The lack of action by the Biden administration on Cuba was highlighted this week after the communist-run island witnessed its largest protests in decades. An administration official confirmed there are no changes on the horizon as the policy is still under review. Biden promised in September 2020, during the campaign, that he would ""try to reverse the failed Trump policies that inflicted harm on Cubans and their families,"" but the review currently underway is unlikely to result in a return to the Obama-era policy of normalized relations with Havana, according to people familiar with the discussions. The thinking is that the Cuban government has shown no signs, in more than five years, of easing its political and economic repression of the Cuban people, which has severely narrowed the Biden administration's options for normalizing ties again -- especially given Biden's emphasis on human rights as a cornerstone of his foreign policy. Biden's team is also wary of the political implications of making concessions to Havana, as Obama did, without getting anything in return. ""Joe Biden is not Barack Obama in policy towards Cuba,"" Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the western hemisphere, told Andres Oppenheimer in April. ""The political moment has changed in an important way, the political space has closed a lot, because the Cuban government has not responded in any way, and in fact the oppression against Cubans is even worse today than perhaps it was during the Bush administration."" Gonzalez added that ""human rights will be a key factor in any conversation that we may have with the regime."" To that end, Biden's team has focused on incremental steps like easing restrictions on remittances that Americans can send to relatives on the island -- which were all but banned under Trump -- and potentially opening up travel again as a way to expose Cubans to American ideals. Other forms of more immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people are also being weighed, as the administration tries to find ways to ""let some of the air out of the pressure cooker"" and defuse the situation before it becomes violent, said one person familiar with the thinking. A second senior administration official said the administration has ""been reviewing our Cuba policy with an eye towards its impact on the political and economic well-being of the Cuban people. Democracy and human rights are central to that assessment."" This official added that ""we are watching the Cuban government's response to the protests very closely, and call on them to refrain from violence and repression against peaceful protesters; and to serve their people rather than enrich themselves."" A congressional aide said discussions have been underway with the administration about opening lines of communication with Cuban protesters and with members of the Cuban military to try to defuse the situation, and to build a coalition of international allies who can send a united message that there will be repercussions if the government reacts violently to the protests. There have also been discussions about how the US can help restore and expand internet access to Cubans, as the regime continues its blackouts, the aide said. ""The Biden administration has been consistent in its calls for the promotion of democracy and human rights in Cuba,"" the second senior administration official said, ""including denouncing abuses by Cuba's authoritarian regime and pushing for reforms. This is not new."" Juan Cruz, who served as NSC senior director for the western hemisphere under Trump, said the US risks getting ""beat over the head by the Cubans"" if it rushes to return to the Obama-era policies amid the protests. There are hopes by some in the administration that this new wave of dissent could create a split within the regime that the US could then capitalize on, Cruz said. But American involvement could backfire and exacerbate tensions even further. ""This is not going to be a 'Cuban spring,'"" he said. ""The administration is not going to go back to the Obama era on this."" Whether Biden will ultimately follow through on his campaign promises remains to be seen. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is a strong opponent of Obama's policies and the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, hinted Monday that he thinks Biden may not. ""I think the President has had a time to review the actual policies under President Obama and all of the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided, unilateral in terms of concessions, showed themselves to create absolutely no change inside of Cuba,"" Menendez told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""So the result of that, I think, is the Biden administration looked and said, 'Wait a minute. That didn't seem to work.'"" On Monday, Menendez and Biden spoke during a brief phone call, according to an official. Biden also told reporters he would talk more publicly about the ongoing crises in Cuba and Haiti later this week. A senior official says he has no formal speech planned but he will likely discuss it more as the US gathers intelligence. How Biden navigates Cuba could carry political implications, given he lost Florida to Trump in the 2020 election after the former President repeatedly claimed Biden would turn the US into a ""socialist country"" if he won, a message that resonated with Cuban Americans. While changing Cuba policy was not among his ""top foreign policy priorities,"" according to top aides, the recent protests have sparked fresh conversations about it inside the West Wing. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets this weekend to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. ""I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- quite frankly, ever,"" Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday. The President said the US ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights,"" and said the Cuban people ""are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime."" He called on the Cuban government to ""refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba."" Biden also told reporters at the White House on Monday that his team was closely monitoring the developments in Haiti in the wake of the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise. He was killed last week on his private residence in the capital of Port-au-Prince, and Haiti's first lady, Martine Moise, was also shot in the attack and evacuated to a hospital in Miami for treatment. Biden on Monday indicated that the US is ""ready to provide assistance"" to both Cuba and Haiti, but it is unclear what form that will take.","['Kaitlan Collins', 'Kate Sullivan', 'Natasha Bertrand']",7/13/2021 12:59,Biden's review of Trump's restrictive Cuba policies still underway,"['underway', 'president', 'policy', 'trumps', 'biden', 'cuban', 'senior', 'policies', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'restrictive', 'bidens', 'political', 'review', 'told', 'administration']","The lack of action by the Biden administration on Cuba was highlighted this week after the communist-run island witnessed its largest protests in decades.

44,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cubans-protest-government-cracks-internet-access-messaging-apps-rcna1400,"As protests grip Cuba, the country's government has taken steps to block citizens use of the encrypted chat apps WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, researchers say. The entire country went offline for more than 30 minutes on Sunday, according to researchers who study internet censorship. Since then, virtual private networks, which are tools used to reroute internet traffic that can circumvent some internet censorship, and popular communication apps in Cuba have been blocked. Cubans have taken to the streets since Sunday to protest against the government in the midst of an economic downturn and a major health crisis, as the country still struggles to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters have organized online and shared videos of police detentions. But since the protests began, the country has experienced widespread online censorship. Various governments including those in Venezuela and Iran have in recent years sought to limit or block internet access during protests. Widespread internet use in Cuba is still relatively new, and Cubans mostly reach the web through their smartphones. The country only has a single major internet provider, the national telecommunications company ETECSA. That means most Cubans have to rely on a single, centralized, government-affiliated hub, making government censorship substantially easier. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring company, said Monday that it had detected disruptions to multiple messaging apps through ETECSAs service. ETECSA did not respond to a request for comment, and has not made a public statement about the outages. A number of messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, are all blocked in Cuba, said Arturo Filasto, the project lead at the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI). OONI, an international nonprofit, relies on volunteers around the world to install a program that probes for which types of internet use are being censored and how. Its data showed that ETECSA began blocking WhatsApp on Sunday night, then Signal and Telegram on Monday. All three were still blocked on Tuesday, Filasto said. ""We have never seen instant messaging apps being blocked in the country,"" he said. ""Its sort of unprecedented that we would see such a heavy crackdown on the internet in Cuba."" Marianne Diaz Hernandez, a fellow at the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, said some Cubans have reported that their specific SIM cards for their phones have been rendered useless, keeping them offline. And some virtual private networks have themselves been blocked, she said. Two major VPNs, Tor and Psiphon, appear to still work. While Cuba has deployed various censorship techniques in the past, this is the first time they have all been deployed at the same time, Hernandez said. ""Since they have had internet, this is the largest blackout in history,"" she said. Grisel Martin, a native of the Cuban city of Matanzas who lives in Miami, said that the blackout has kept her from communicating with family there. ""The latest news I got from them was Sunday, July 11, 5:10 p.m. through WhatsApp, saying that my aunt had a fever the previous night,"" Martin said. ""We feel so desperate and powerless,"" she said.

It is a for-profit company, not a non-profit organization.","['Kevin Collier Is A Reporter Covering Cybersecurity', 'Privacy', 'Technology Policy For Nbc News.']",7/13/2021 14:41,"As Cubans protest, government cracks down on internet access and messaging apps","['cracks', 'access', 'protest', 'apps', 'telegram', 'whatsapp', 'internet', 'blocked', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'nonprofit', 'censorship', 'country', 'signal', 'messaging']","As protests grip Cuba, the country's government has taken steps to block citizens use of the encrypted chat apps WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, researchers say.

45,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2021/07/13/biden-lifts-sanctions-venezuela-giving-cuba-lifeline/,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury on Monday lifted sanctions on the export of gas to socialist Venezuela, a boon to the dictatorship in Caracas and its patron government in communist Cuba, which struggles to suppress mounting opposition and calls for the regimes total abolition. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued a general license number 40, permitting ""all transactions and activities related to the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, of liquefied petroleum gas to Venezuela"" as well as the socialist regimes state-owned affiliates, specifically rescinding restrictions that then-President Donald Trump imposed via three executive orders in 2018 and 2019. The license remains valid through July 8, 2022. Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the state-owned company managing the nations (and some of the worlds) largest oil reserves, fell under socialist control in 1998, when Hugo Chavez nationalized the entity. With socialist cronies in charge, Venezuelas oil production began to decline at a rapid rate, falling to levels not seen since 1947 by mid-2020. Despite abundant supply, the mismanagement is so great the nation routinely experiences severe gasoline shortages. OFAC left intact sanctions on individual Venezuelan government officials, many of whom allegedly maintain ties with drug cartels, human trafficking organizations, or terrorist cells. Television star Diosdado Cabello, the first vice president of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela PSUV) and Maduros second-in-command, has for years been identified as a major figure in the international drug trade, with informants naming him as the leader of the Cartel de los Soles. The group, run out of the Venezuelan military, operates an international cocaine ring. Formerly the richest nation in Latin America - following the decline of previously richest nation Cuba under communism - due to its vast oil reserves, years of socialist mismanagement have driven the Venezuelan economy into the ground. Inflation in particular has annihilated citizens personal wealth and forced a majority of Venezuelans to eschew the local currency in favor of foreign bills will stable value. A 2020 study revealed that a majority of transactions in Venezuela occurred using the U.S. dollar as a medium. The economy has deteriorated to the extent that citizens have resorted to scavenging food from street trash to avoid starvation. In lieu of stable healthcare infrastructure, Venezuelans have had to improvise means of tending to their sick and injured, with one viral video depicting locals using the back of a garbage truck as an ambulance. The easing of economic restrictions against Caracas will likely provide an economic boost to the socialist dictatorship under Nicolas Maduro, which has maintained power illegally through the military since the expiration of his last legitimate term in 2019. By extension, Cuba -- the regimes de facto colonial overlord -- will secure a much-needed economic windfall amid its struggles to contain both the Chinese coronavirus and a wave of democratic protests. Havana has effectively run Venezuela for years. Maduro defectors and foreign relations experts have reported that the country relies heavily on nearly 100,000 Cuban communist agents to manage the national ""revolution"" since at least 2010. Reports further indicate that Cuba uses its colony as a staging ground for its drug trafficking operations and as a meeting place for its allied terrorist groups like the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization. Caracas has further served as an economic lifeline for Havana, supplying much of the regimes energy needs on credit, with extremely lenient terms. Director of Petroleum for Venezuela Francisco Rodriguez asserted in 2020 that Cuba owed over $11 billion to Venezuela, with a doubtful prospect for repayment. Beginning Sunday, thousands of Cubans took to the streets of at least 20 cities, demanding an end to communism on the island. Originating in San Antonio de los Banos, protesters shouted ""Down with communism!"" and "" fuck Diaz-Canel!"" referencing the nations puppet president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, whom Raul Castro appointed to be the regimes public face. The ""president"" has since called for communists to violently confront the demonstrators and overseen a brutal police crackdown. As of Monday, at least 57 dissidents, including Roman Catholic priests, street artists, and peace activists have been confirmed to be in police custody.",['Ben Whedon'],7/13/2021 15:40,"Joe Biden Lifts Sanctions on Venezuela, Giving Cuba a Lifeline","['sanctions', 'socialist', 'giving', 'venezuelan', 'president', 'nation', 'lifts', 'biden', 'oil', 'foreign', 'cuba', 'venezuela', 'regimes', 'economic', 'lifeline', 'joe']","With socialist cronies in charge, Venezuelas oil production began to decline at a rapid rate, falling to levels not seen since 1947 by mid-2020.

46,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/cuba-90-year-old-raul-castro-resurfaces-to-silence-protests/,"The Communist Party of Cuba trotted out 90-year-old Raul Castro - the nations ultimate leader despite his official retirement - on Monday, claiming he participated in a Politburo meeting on the protests hitting the island on Sunday. Cubans in at least 20 localities around the island organized peaceful manifestations on Sunday believed to have attracted thousands of people. Many marched chanting ""freedom!"" and slogans in opposition to communism. The immediate response from the Communist Party was violence; Cubans have uploaded multiple videos to social media appearing to show police officers opening fire on crowds of protesters, beating them with batons on the streets, and arresting and disappearing participants in the protests. Manifestations continued throughout Monday but the regime shut down access to the internet nearly across the country, preventing Cubans from sharing breaking news from the island outside of encrypted messages and some isolated images. The official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and state television claimed that Castro participated in the meeting alongside President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who Castro hand-picked to be the face of the Party. Cuba experts consider Castro and his extended family the ultimate bosses in Cuba, however, as many hold high-ranking military and Party positions and Raul Castro himself still resurfaces for events the Party deems important enough. Granma did not describe the meeting as an ""emergency"" gathering but gave the impression that it was an urgent attempt to organize a response to the protests. The meeting reportedly occurred on Sunday, but was the lead story on Granma's online homepage on Tuesday morning. ""During the meeting, the provocations orchestrated by counterrevolutionary elements, organized and financed from the United States with destabilizing purposes, were analyzed,"" Granma reported. Granma offered no other information. It published no images that would prove that the nonagenarian dictator was present at the meeting. While its front-page headline promised video content, the video was a news report by communist media featuring only an anchor sitting at a desk and reporting that the meeting had occurred. Prominently advertising Castros involvement in decisionmaking surrounding the protests appears to be a response to the outsized attention the protests have given Diaz-Canel. A longtime Communist Party lackey, Diaz-Canel first became president of the country in 2018. The Cuban constitution states that the president of the country is outranked by the Chairman of the Communist Party of Cuba and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Castro held all three titles before giving Diaz-Canel the presidency, remaining his boss. At the time, Diaz-Canel promised Castro would ""preside over all major decisions for the present and future of the nation."" Castro claimed to have retired in April 2021, giving Diaz-Canel the title of chairman of the Party. His public return indicates, however, that Diaz-Canel still lacks ultimate authority in the country. Protests continued - and, reportedly, intensified - on Monday. The few images surfacing show severely injured unarmed protesters. One video appeared to show an unconscious man bleeding to death on the street while bystanders attempting to wrap the gunshot wound in his head with cloth to save him. Amnesty International has confirmed 115 arrests as of Tuesday, many of them of prominent members of the Cuban dissident community who have been subject to routine arbitrary detentions for decades. Cubalex, an independent human rights group, documented over 150 people either missing or in police custody without being accused of a crime as of Tuesday and continues to update its database in real time. The U.S.-based Marti News reported on Tuesday that the Communist Party had deployed motorized gangs to attack the protests - a staple repressive tactic of Cubas colony, Venezuela. The violence followed a direct order from Diaz-Canel, issued in a televised speech, late on Sunday to ""revolutionaries"" to take the streets and attack peaceful protesters. Diaz-Canel called it an ""order of combat"" against ""counterrevolutionaries"" and explicitly urged violence. On Monday, Diaz-Canel posted another call to violence on Twitter. ""The Cuban Revolution will not turn the other cheek to those who attack it, in both virtual and real-life spaces,"" Diaz-Canel wrote, an apparent rebuke of Christian doctrine. The Communist Party is explicitly atheist and has regularly persecuted Christians of all denominations since 1959. The Castro regime actively persecuted Christians in the 1960s by placing them in the Military Units to Aid Production (UMAP), labor camps for ""undesirables"" and ""counterrevolutionaries."" Several of those arrested and beaten on Sunday and Monday are members of Christian clergy. ""Let us avoid revolutionary violence but we will repress counterrevolutionary violence,"" Diaz-Canels statement on Twitter continued. ""Whoever attacks the agents of order attacks the country."" Despite the call to ""repression,"" Diaz-Canels tweet remains available on that platform at press time. La #RevolucionCubana no va a poner la otra mejilla a quienes la atacan en espacios virtuales y reales. Evitaremos la violencia revolucionaria, pero reprimiremos la violencia contrarrevolucionaria. Quien ataca a los agentes del orden ataca al pais #SomosCuba pic.twitter.com/7lLPk30wcV -- Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez (@DiazCanelB) July 12, 2021 Granma reported on Monday that, following the Politburo meeting and call to violence, Diaz-Canel held a Party meeting on Monday to discuss several unrelated topics, apparently ignoring the protests. Among them was the failing Cuban power grid and its fully collapsed socialist healthcare system.

47,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/13/palmetto-expressway-shut-down-because-of-protesters/,"MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A small group of protesters asking President Joe Biden and Gov. Ron DeSantis to help protect Cuban protesters marched to block traffic on the Palmetto Expressway on a rainy Tuesday in Miami-Dade County. One of their chants in Spanish: ""Estados Unidos, acaba el comunismo!"" Its a rhymed request for the Biden administration to put an end to communism. Demonstrators confront police as they try to get onto the Palmetto Expressway, Tuesday, July 13, 2021, in Miami. Demonstrators are protesting in solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who waged a rare weekend of protests around their island nation against the communist regime. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) (Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.) They lined up for hours under the rain on the southbound and northbound lanes of the expressway. Officers and Florida Highway Patrol troopers blocked access from Coral Way to Flagler Street. Some of the protesters who have relatives on the island said they fear the Cuban governments violent crackdown on dissent. Cubans report having internet connectivity problems and power outages since the Sunday protest. Related story: Drivers on Okeechobee Road show solidarity with SOS Cuba protesters disrupting traffic Ad Miami-Dade Police Department officers and Florida Highway Patrol troopers asked drivers to avoid the expressway and use the Florida Turnpike instead. They were also negotiating with the protesters, reminding them that blocking roads is illegal in Florida. Some of the protesters held umbrellas, and white, red, and blue Cuban and U.S. flags. Some used signs and T-shirts to display the ""Patria Y Vida,"" or ""Homeland and Life,"" motto of the protests across Cuba Sunday. The phrase is meant to antagonize the late Fidel Castros rallying cry of ""Socialism or Death"" and the late Che Guevaras ""Homeland or Death"" speech at the United Nations in the 1960s. The expressways southbound lanes reopened briefly at first and shut down again. Officers kept a group of protesters away from the expressway near a gas station where customers were trapped in. Ad Another group of protesters crossed through the yellow crime scene tape blocking access to the ramp and joined the demonstration. A family cheers while on the Palmetto Expressway, Tuesday, July 13, 2021, in Miami. The demonstrators, many of them Cuban exiles, expressed support for Cubans, who had taken to the streets of several communities around the communist nation on Sunday to air grievances over poor economic conditions, among other complaints. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) (Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.) For some, it was a family activity with parents and grandparents. Some took toddlers to the protest. There were groups of teenagers. Some played music and used pots and pans to make noise. They were working to make sure the US and allies hear Cubans cries for help. Many are in communication with relatives and friends who are learning about the victims of aggressive police tactics in Havana and other cities. Activists reported violent raids and arbitrary arrests continued Tuesday. The rare act of desperation made headlines worldwide, but Cuban Americans in South Florida want to make sure people dont just forget. There were demonstrations in Miami-Dade County Sunday night, Monday and there were plans to continue through the week.

48,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/beijing-lends-fellow-communists-hand-china-stands-ready-work-cuba/,"The Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed on Tuesday that the United States was single-handedly responsible for all woes that Cuban people suffer under communism and asserted Beijing ""stands ready to work with Cuba,"" presumably to suppress the nationwide protests that began this weekend. Cuba is a member of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an infrastructure debt trap program run by the Communist Party of China, and is one of Beijings oldest allies. Both countries are members of the United Nations Human Rights Council and energetically defend themselves in that venue against the overwhelming evidence of human rights atrocities committed by their respective regimes. Protests erupted in at least 20 municipalities throughout Cuba on Sunday calling for an end to the 62-year communist rule people have endured there. While Cuban dissident organizations have invested decades in organizing civil society to demand respect for their basic civil rights, plans to challenge the regime accelerated this year as groups organized conventions to plan a transition out of communism and focused attempting on recruiting pop stars and other artists to the cause. Chronic food shortages and a collapsed healthcare system, hallmarks of all communists regimes, exacerbated the need for protests during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, the official responsible for the discredited conspiracy theory that the Chinese coronavirus originated in a U.S. Army laboratory, issued the first comment from the Chinese government on the ongoing protests in Cuba on Tuesday. ""China firmly opposes foreign interference in Cubas internal affairs, firmly supports what Cuba has done in fighting COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], improving peoples livelihood and upholding social stability,"" Zhao said, ""and firmly supports Cuba in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions."" Cuba has a notoriously poor track record in handling the coronavirus pandemic that includes inviting tourists from hotspots like Italy to visit the island at the height of the pandemic and refusing to shut down schools. ""Id like to stress that China stands ready to work with Cuba to implement the important consensus of the two heads of state and is firmly committed to deepening friendly relations between the two countries,"" Zhao added. He did not specify in what way China would be ""ready to work"" with Cuba, leaving open the possibility that Beijing would support Cubas repression of dissidents in the context of the protests this week. Cuban human rights groups believe hundreds of peaceful protesters are either in police custody illegally or have disappeared. Death tolls have not surfaced so far but dissidents have shared videos on social media showing police opening fire into crowds of unarmed protesters, leaving some on the ground, bloodied and appearing to suffer from gunshot wounds. Other images out of Cuba show police flagrantly beating unarmed protesters in broad daylight. Zhao also took the opportunity to condemn the government of the United States, which has played no role in the protests. ""As the Cuban side pointed out, the US embargo is the root cause of Cubas shortage of medicines and energy,"" Zhao falsely claimed. ""The US should fully lift its embargo on Cuba and play a positive role in helping the Cuban people overcome the effects of the epidemic."" The U.S. ""embargo"" does not prevent shipments of medicine or humanitarian supplies to Cuba. It has also done little to prevent tourism to the island, and it does not prevent Cuba from trading with over 190 countries around the world. The true embargo banning humanitarian aid from directly reaching Cubans in necessary quantities is a policy implemented by the Castro regime once American supplies arrive in Communist Party custody, where much of it disappears into the bureaucracy instead of the hands of its intended recipients. China extended its support to Cuba on the anniversary of the 1994 massacre of 41 civilians on the March 13 tugboat, at the time attempting to flee the country by sea to the United States. Cuban officials flooded the vessel, carrying 72 people, using hoses in international waters. Several of the victims were toddlers; the youngest was a six-month-old girl. China became Cubas largest trade partner in 2017 and began investing heavily in Cuban infrastructure after Miguel Diaz-Canel, appointed the face of the Castro regime in 2018, visited Beijing that year and signed onto the Belt and Road Initiative. ""As socialist countries, China and Cuba are good friends, comrades, and brothers,"" Chinese dictator Xi Jinping said during his meeting with Diaz-Canel at the time. ""Chinese people will never forget that Cuba, led by Comrade Fidel Castro, was the first nation in the western hemisphere to forge diplomatic ties with China 58 years ago."" A year later, Cuba debuted a Chinese-built railway connecting Havana and Santiago de Cuba, the countrys two largest cities on opposite ends of the island. No evidence suggests Cuban citizens received jobs or benefits from the infrastructure project in any way, as Cuba bought the rail cars pre-made from China with a 15-year Chinese loan. Like most BRI agreements, the provisions of the deal remain a secret.

Many described it as a potential turning point in a country where the Communist Party has managed to stifle even small challenges to its authority for decades. ""The spark has been lit, ladies and gentlemen, theres no turning back,"" the independent journalist Yoani Sanchez said in a brief podcast she recorded on Tuesday. ""People felt what its like to scream freedom in the streets of Cuba."" The Cuban government often detains dissidents for a day or two after security forces break up demonstrations. It was unclear whether Sundays detentions would lead to a new generation of long term political prisoners. Daniel Triana, a Cuban actor who was held at a Havana detention center for about 24 hours, described a flood of protesters being led into the cell where he was kept. ""A lot of people throughout the country are still detained, I would say hundreds,"" he said in a phone interview. ""In my wing, there were dozens of people and they were bringing in people when I got there, and they were bringing in people when I left."" Camila Remon, a member of Movimiento San Isidro, said the recent protests were enabled by widespread internet connectivity on the Island, a relatively new phenomenon.","['Ernesto Londoño', 'Frances Robles']",7/13/2021 22:08,'The Spark Has Been Lit': Cuban Dissidents Feel Emboldened Despite Crackdown,"['streets', 'despite', 'wing', 'lit', 'yoani', 'feel', 'cuban', 'bringing', 'turning', 'day', 'spark', 'crackdown', 'country', 'emboldened', 'dissidents', 'described']","Many described it as a potential turning point in a country where the Communist Party has managed to stifle even small challenges to its authority for decades.

A protest broke out in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday in support of the anti-government protesters in Cuba and participants appealed to the Biden administration to take a firmer stance on the crackdown in Havana. ""Where is Biden?"" the protesters chanted, according to Fox 13 News. ""Where is Biden?"" Protests have broken out across the state and this particular rally resulted in three arrests after the protesters blocked traffic on Dale Mabry Highway and forced the partial closure of Interstate 275. The demonstrators yelled, ""Cuba Libre!"" 'A SPARK HAS BEEN LIT The report said two men face charges of battery on an officer and resisting arrest, another faces charges of resisting arrest. The Biden administration has said it stands by the people of Cuba who demand basic human rights. President Biden called the protests ""remarkable"" and a ""clarion call for freedom."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted that the U.S. ""stands with the Cuban people seeking freedom and respect for their human rights."" He called the violence against peaceful protestors ""abhorrent."" The White House did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the administration is considering how it could be ""helpful directly to the people of Cuba."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said the Biden administration can impose new sanctions, open up satellite Internet access on the island and ""issue a clear and unambiguous statement that the current U.S. policies towards the regime implemented by the Trump administration will remain in place,"" according to the Washington Post. The Cuban government has blamed those U.S. policies for the economic hardship faced in the country. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana on Sunday to lash out at the worsening conditions in the country under the communist regime - the biggest protest in decades - prompting the countrys president to call on ""revolutionary"" citizens to counter the protesters. The Miami Herald reported that some Democrats in South Florida want Biden to deliver a clear message of support to the protesters in Cuba from Miami and compared the moment to Ronald Reagan's 'Tear Down this wall speech. ""I really believe this is one of those moments, I put it up with the moment of 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall because I do believe we can give the hope to the people in Cuba,"" state Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Democrat, told the Herald. ""Its really about the people in Cuba who need to hear it. The words of the president of the U.S., be it Republican or Democrat, should matter.""

51,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/7/14/cuba-restricts-access-to-social-media-apps-to-curb-protests,"Mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests and activists say government is restricting access to messaging apps. Cuba has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks has said, in the wake of the biggest anti-government protests in decades. Thousands of Cubans joined demonstrations throughout the Communist-run country on Sunday to protest against a deep economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. NetBlocks, based in London, said on its website on Tuesday that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram in Cuba were partially disrupted on Monday and Tuesday. ""The pattern of restrictions observed in Cuba indicate an ongoing crackdown on messaging platforms used to organise and share news of protests in real-time,"" said NetBlocks director Alp Toker. ""At the same time, some connectivity is preserved to maintain a semblance of normality."" Cubas government has said the demonstrations were orchestrated by counterrevolutionaries financed by the United States, manipulating frustration with an economic crisis largely caused by the decades-old US trade embargo. The protests, rare in a country where public dissent is tightly controlled, had largely ended by Sunday evening, as security forces were deployed to the streets and President Miguel Diaz-Canel called on government supporters to go out and fight to defend their revolution. But another protest flared late on Monday in the southern Havana suburb of La Guinera, where one man died and several others, including members of the security forces, were hospitalised with injuries, according to state-run media on Tuesday. It did not say what caused the death. No other deaths and injuries have been officially confirmed so far. Hundreds had taken to streets in La Guinera, shouting slogans such as ""Down with communism"" and ""Freedom for the people of Cuba"" according to two residents and video footage seen by the Reuters news agency. Some started throwing rocks at security forces who eventually responded with gunfire, said resident Waldo Herrera, 49. ""I think the Communists have lost control, they wont have a solution to this situation,"" he said. ""The people are tired of so much humiliation, so much repression."" A Reuters witness saw dozens of people carrying sticks departing La Guinera late on Monday. Activists say the government is using so-called rapid-reaction brigades - government-organised bands of civilian recruits - to counter protesters. Mobile internet disrupted They also accuse the government of trying to disrupt communications. Introduced just over two years ago, mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests, giving Cubans more of a platform to express their frustrations and enabling the word to get out quickly when people are on the street. In the capital, there have been regular and atypical mobile internet outages since Sunday, according to Reuters witnesses. Facebook Inc, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said that it was concerned about its services being restricted in Cuba, in a statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. ""We oppose shutdowns, throttling, and other disruptions of the internet that limit the debate of our community. We hope connectivity will be restored as soon as possible so that Cubans can communicate with family and friends,"" said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman. Asked whether the government was intentionally restricting internet connections, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told a news briefing the situation was ""complicated."" He said power outages could affect telecommunications services and ""Cuba would never renounce the right to defend itself"". Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter Inc said it found no blocking of its service. ""Our weapon is the internet. If they take away the internet we are unarmed,"" said Havana resident Gino Ocumares, as he tried but failed to connect to the internet at a government WiFi hotspot. ""The government does not want people to see the truth."" 'Provocations The protest in La Guinera was spearheaded by ""antisocial and criminal elements"" that had tried to reach the police station with the aim of attacking its officials and damaging infrastructure, said the state-run Cuban News Agency. Cuba says 'antisocial and criminal elements are behind the protests [File: Yamil Lage/AFP] When security forces stopped them, they vandalised homes, set containers on fire, and damaged the suburbs electrical wiring, attacking officials with stones and other objects, the agency said. State-run media also reported on Tuesday that Raul Castro, who stepped down as head of the ruling Cuban Communist Party in April, attended a meeting on Sunday of the political bureau to address the ""provocations"". Diaz-Canel said in April he would continue to consult Castro on matters of utmost importance. The Cuban Bishops Conference said in a statement it was worried that the response to protests over legitimate concerns would be ""immobilism"" rather than an attempt to resolve them, and even a counterproductive hardening of positions. Reaction to the protest in Latin America split along ideological lines, with Mexicos president blaming the US embargo for fomenting the unrest, while Chile and Peru urged the government to allow pro-democracy protests. US President Joe Biden said on Monday that the United States ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights"". State Department spokesman Ned Price called on the Havana government to open all means of communication, online and offline. ""Shutting down technology, shutting down information pathways - that does nothing to address the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Cuban people,"" Price told a news briefing on Tuesday.",[],7/14/2021 4:46,Cuba restricts access to social media apps to curb protests,"['security', 'media', 'access', 'protest', 'apps', 'guinera', 'whatsapp', 'cuban', 'internet', 'protests', 'la', 'cuba', 'curb', 'social', 'restricts', 'forces']","Mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests and activists say government is restricting access to messaging apps.

Senator John Kennedy told Fox News' Harris Faulkner on ""The Faulkner Focus"" that Biden needs to be actively working with world leaders to support the Cuban people. 'WHERE IS BIDEN? CHANT BREAKS OUT AT FLORIDA PROTEST IN SUPPORT OF CUBAA SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: What's happening in Cuba is - it's a contradiction for me. It's both beautiful, but it also disgusts me to my core. It's beautiful because what we're seeing is people's innate thirst for freedom. Our desire for freedom is deeply seeded. It's almost part of the human condition. And the Cuban people want their freedom. When Castro took over, he promised them freedom. Instead, he gave them socialism, which we now know, of course, is just trickle-down poverty. So that part is beautiful. And I think we ought to do everything we can to support the people, the good people of Cuba. What I find disgusting is the fact that all President Biden has done is issue a press release. That's it. I don't even know if he read the thing. President Biden needs to be on the telephone. He needs to be calling the leaders of the UK, of Canada, of New Zealand, of Australia, of India, of Japan, of South Korea, of the European Union, and saying let's issue a joint statement supporting the people of Cuba. Let's talk about additional sanctions on the Castro government. We've got the Castro government down now, the people have. Let's choke him to death.

54,https://nypost.com/2021/07/14/airstrikes-against-cuban-regime-should-be-considered-miami-mayor-suarez-says/,"The mayor of Miami, Florida, has called on the US to consider military action to overthrow the Communist regime in Cuba -- even if that means launching airstrikes. Francis Suarez -- whose father was Miamis first Cuban-born mayor -- told Fox News on Tuesday that ""what should be being contemplated right now is a coalition of potential military action in Cuba."" He highlighted previous US military action in Panama, Kosovo and Pakistan, the latter of which ""probably saved thousands"" of lives by killing Osama bin Laden when President Biden was vice president. ""Are you suggesting airstrikes in Cuba?"" Fox News host Martha MacCallum asked. ""What Im suggesting is that that option is one that has to be explored and cannot be just simply discarded as an option that is not on the table,"" Suarez insisted. Cubans take part in a demonstration in support of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canels government in Arroyo Naranjo, Havana. AFP via Getty Images ""Thats something that needs to be discussed and needs to looked as a potential option in addition to a variety of other options that can be discussed."" He later told the Miami Herald that he was expecting a call from the president -- and planned to ask him to consider military intervention. ""Its difficult for any elected official, Republican or Democrat, not to take the side of the Cuban people when they see images of people risking their lives, protesting in the streets,"" he said of the mass demonstrations. Suarez also stressed that ""the Cuban people are not asking for the lifting of an embargo"" enforced by the US. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images He also stressed that ""the Cuban people are not asking for the lifting of an embargo"" enforced by the US, which Cuban officials and many on the left have blamed for the protests. ""Theyre not yelling out, 'End the embargo. Theyre not yelling out, 'We need food. Theyre yelling out, 'We want liberty, we want freedom,'"" he told MacCallum. ""Theyre going out on the streets every single day talking about the failure of the Communist regime to provide for its people. And it has failed for six decades,"" he said. Since protests broke out in Cuba over the weekend, thousands have also taken to the streets of Florida, home to the largest US population of Cuban Americans -- closing down a number of major roads on Tuesday. State troopers stand guard as people block Palmetto Expressway during a protest showing support for Cubans demonstrating against their government, in Miami. AFP via Getty Images As hundreds of others also rallied at a Miami park, a large group shouted support for the Cuban protesters as they blocked traffic on Miamis Palmetto Expressway in the afternoon. For a second day, Cuban Americans in Tampa gathered Tuesday at an intersection, blocking traffic and waving Cuban flags. Like the group in South Florida, Tampa demonstrators attempted to gain access to Interstate 275, but police held them back. Orlando also had hundreds of protesters blocking a busy street for about an hour Tuesday.

55,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/biden-inaction-triggers-growing-calls-us-military-action-cuba/,"A series of tepid and inaccurate statements from President Joe Biden and his administration are meeting growing calls this week for the American government to act to prevent the further loss of life in Cuba. Protesters took the streets in dozens of municipalities nationwide in Cuba on Sunday; some estimates suggest as many as 60 cities and towns rose up demanding an end to communism. The protests were the culmination of nearly two decades of organized dissident action in the country since the Black Spring of 2003, that last major violent crackdown en masse on pro-democracy voices in the country. Protesters chanted ""freedom!"" and other anti-communist slogans, making clear their demand was an end to the 62-year-old Castro regime. The Cuban Communist Party responded by issuing an ""order of combat"" commanding all communist loyalists to take the streets and violently assault peaceful protesters. It also shut down the internet for much of this week, making international reporting on the matter extremely difficult. The little information Cubans have managed to get out of the island indicates that protests have continued daily since Sunday despite widespread reports of police gang beatings, assassinations, and deadly door-to-door raids. The violence, much of it caught on video, prompted a wave of protests nationwide in the United States in solidarity with the protesters. Cuban-Americans in every major population hub they have in the country have taken the streets in urged Biden to do more than offer verbal solidarity with their brethren. Bidens administration has so far falsely stated that the protests are about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic -- on multiple occasions -- and has taken no action in response to the situation. Biden himself issued a statement urging ""the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" without mentioning communism or socialism, the issues the protesters are actively opposing. Protesters around the country have escalated their calls for military intervention against the Castro regime to defend the lives of unarmed, peaceful Cuban protesters. In front of the White House, protesters on Monday called for ""urgent military intervention"" in remarks to Univision. In Miami, a group of protesters demanding military intervention blocked the Palmetto Expressway, the main highway in the city, on Tuesday. ""The longer we wait the more people will die. The longer that America waits to intervene the more people will die,"" one Miami protester told a local ABC News affiliate. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) made the most prominent call for U.S. military action so far on Fox News on Tuesday. ""What should be being contemplated right now is a coalition of potential military action in Cuba similar to what has happened in both administrations in both Republican and Democrat administrations,"" Suarez said. ""And Republican -- with Bush in Panama, they deposed Noriega. And that country had peaceful democracy for decades. And you had interventions by a Democratic president taking out Osama bin Laden in Pakistan."" Suarez added that airstrikes against the regime is an option ""that has to be explored and cannot be just simply discarded as an option that is not on the table."" Suarez made a similar call to action in a press conference prior to the interview this week, joined by several other prominent American politicians including Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL). At least one Democrat in the country -- the mayor of Union City, New Jersey, the largest Cuban-American enclave in the country outside of Florida -- has similarly demanded military intervention. ""We need to see action. We need to see military action,"" Mayor Brian Stack told hundreds assembled at a rally on Tuesday in New Jerseys north Hudson region. Speaking to NJ.com, Stack added, ""I believe the United States shouldve been there years ago. Just like weve liberated other countries, we should liberate Cuba, make that country free for the Cuban people. Stop all the politics all around."" A petition at Change.org urging military intervention has attracted nearly 400,000 signatures as of Wednesday, suggesting the idea is more popular than many establishment media outlets in the United States have suggested. ""The free Cubans around the world petition, without a doubt, for a MILITARY INTERVENTION by the United States of America and NATO to put an end to the Castro/Diaz-Canel regime and liberate the Cuban people who live in terror, misery, hunger and coercion!"" the petition reads in part. What such an intervention would look like is the subject of much speculation -- and much debate. The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a coalition of dissident organizations on the island, published a five-point plan to liberate Cuba on Sunday: The termination of the Regime is non-negotiable. All those involved in the peaceful civic protest must stay out in the streets and maintain their commitment to a free Cuba. All national Police and Armed Forces must support the citizens and uphold their duty to their country and not the communist regime. International intervention led by the United States in order to prevent a bloodbath. The immediate cessation of all tourism to Cuba until the dictatorship has been dismantled. Speaking to Breitbart News, Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, the director of the Assembly, listed military intervention as one of the factors in a greater plan for the U.S. government to properly aid the Cuban people. Cuban activists, he noted, must ""push for decisive international intervention led by the U.S. to protect the Cuban people and isolate and end the communist regime."" ""Intervention means decisive military action,"" Gutierrez-Boronat added. ""There are many different ways of this being done -- humanitarian assistance, but also as part of the military intervention, that is the most important and decisive."" The Assembly further demands the U.S. government not lift any sanctions against Cuba ""or its satellite regimes in the region"" (Biden already defied this one by lifting sanctions on Venezuela on Monday), help improve telecommunications on the island to prevent the regime from shutting down internet and cutting information access; and recognizing a provisional authority of members of the Cuban resistance to help guide the transition away from communism. Assembly members have been working for months on a plan to facilitate the peaceful transition away from the current regime. Over 20 organizations belonging to the Assembly organized a nationwide ""Congress of the Cuban Nation"" last month to discuss the political underpinnings of a post-communist, free Cuba, including the creation of a transition government and free and fair elections. The meetings sought to create ""a new republic -- [to] create a roadmap for transition and reconstruction of the country in all sectors.""

MIAMI - Graphic video out of Cuba recounts violent encounter with special units the Cuban government uses called ""Boinas Negras,"" to intimidate protestors on the communist island. It is exactly what Leticia Ramos Herreria, an outspoken member of the Ladies in White, an organization that engages in peaceful protests for freedom in Cuba, described hearing about.

She said they shot her husband and took him away in a wheelbarrow, leaving a puddle of blood inside her home, with her children present. According to another Facebook post, she later said her husband is alive. Ad Cubas Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, responded to Sundays protests, saying they were limited in scale and they were orchestrated by the United States. Rodriguez also sent the United States a warning. ""Im warning the American government that its irresponsible conduct could have grave consequences, that may damage the interest of both countries,"" said Rodriguez. On Wednesday, the Biden administration addressed how they are approaching Cuba policy, given the protests. ""Certainly the events, the protests, the reaction, the continued oppression of the Cuban people, weighs in on our decision making process,"" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. Meanwhile in South Florida, Cuban Americans continue their protests in solidarity with Cubans on the island, near Versailles Restaurant in Little Havana.

Ron DeSantis suggested Tuesday that Florida-based companies should attempt to provide internet access to Cuba after the communist country shut off the internet to suppress recent protests and dissent. ""What does the regime do when you start to see these images?"" DeSantis said during a press conference referring to videos coming out of Cuba showing violent government crackdowns against anti-communist protesters in the streets. ""They shut down the internet. They dont want the truth to be out, they dont want people to be able to communicate."" LIVE UPDATES: CUBA'S CRACKDOWN DOESN'T SILENCE PROTESTERS, GOVERNMENT CONFIRMS 1 MAN DEAD DeSantis continued, ""And so one of the things I think we should be able to do with our private companies or with the United States is to provide some of that internet via satellite. We have companies on the Space Coast that launch these things."" The Florida Republican said that he would reach out to some Florida internet providers to ""see what are the options"" to make his plan a reality. DeSantiss office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. CUBAN AMERICAN PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN EXPRESSWAY IN MIAMI, BLAME BIDEN FOR LACK OF SUPPORT Thousands of Cubans have taken to the streets to oppose the communist government that has had a stranglehold on power for the last six decades, and the government reported that at least one person has died. Cubas president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has blamed the United States for the turmoil and called for his supporters to take to the streets to fight back against the protests . ""We are prepared to do anything,"" he said. ""We will be battling in the streets."" The unrest in Cuba has spilled into the United States, where protesters in support of Cuban independence took to the streets in Tampa, Florida and called on President Biden to take action . ""Where is Biden?"" the protesters could be heard chanting. ""Where is Biden?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden released a statement earlier this week that said, ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime."" On Tuesday, Bidens Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned Cubans that if they attempt to flee the island nation they will not be welcomed into the United States and will instead be settled somewhere else. ""The time is never right to attempt migration by sea,"" Mayorkas said at a press conference. ""To those who risk their lives doing so, this risk is not worth taking. Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States.""",['Andrew Miller'],7/14/2021 19:19,DeSantis calls on Florida companies to provide internet to Cuba after government shuts it down,"['shuts', 'states', 'streets', 'desantis', 'united', 'florida', 'fox', 'internet', 'cuba', 'calls', 'shut', 'companies', 'provide', 'protesters']","Ron DeSantis suggested Tuesday that Florida-based companies should attempt to provide internet access to Cuba after the communist country shut off the internet to suppress recent protests and dissent.

58,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/white-house-may-ease-ban-remittances-part-cuba-review-sources-2021-07-14/,"WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's review of Trump-era Cuba policy could lead to big changes in the U.S. posture toward the communist government in Havana as U.S. officials take stock of large protests in that country. The White House says Biden's primary goal is helping the people of Cuba as they reel from pandemic-driven economic woes. Two sources familiar with the review said on Wednesday it could lead to the easing of restrictions on payments Americans can make to their families in Cuba. Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually, representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism.

Biden is also considering reviving the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, which had provided a legal way for Cuban families to be reunited in the United States, the sources said. Trump's withdrawal of U.S. diplomats from Cuba in 2017 in response to mysterious, possibly sonic, attacks on Americans in Havana basically froze the reunification program. Cuban-born Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday warned Cubans and Haitians not to attempt to enter the United States illegally by sea, saying the trek was too dangerous and they would be repatriated. read more The Cuba review is being coordinated by the White House National Security Council with input from the State and Defense departments as well as the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. The outcome of the review is not considered imminent. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters the Cuba policy review is being conducted ""with an eye toward its impact on the political and economic well-being of the Cuban people."" ""There's no question that the protests over the weekend and the events of the last several days are significant events, and it was the largest protest we've seen in Cuba in a long time. That will obviously have an impact on how we proceed,"" she said. to Cuba Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Reporting By Steve Holland; editing by Patricia Zengerle and Alistair Bell Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",['Steve Holland'],7/14/2021 20:48,White House may ease ban on remittances as part of Cuba review -sources,"['security', 'states', 'white', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'house', 'ease', 'ban', 'unlimited', 'remittances', 'review', 'united', 'sources']","The White House says Biden's primary goal is helping the people of Cuba as they reel from pandemic-driven economic woes.

59,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/14/cubans-rally-in-florida-communism-the-last-thing-you-want-for-a-country-like-america/,"NAPLES, Florida - Hundreds of Cubans gathered in south Florida on Tuesday to protest -- not the lack of medical supplies in Cuba -- but the brutal communist regime abusing their family and friends back home. Cuban and American flags filled the streets of downtown Naples as protesters joined others around the country and in Cuba to oppose a dictatorship that has gripped the island since 1959, when Fidel Castro took over. ""It is misinformation that COVID [Chinese coronavirus] and hunger is causing the protests in Cuba. Thats not the truth. People are tired of the government. They are tired of not being free, and thats what they are fighting for,"" said protester and local singer Yenier Alvarino, who is part of a musical duo with Adrian Arteaga called Arteaga y El Yen. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in at least 20 provinces in Cuba on Sunday to peacefully demand the end of communism. The waves of discontent were captured on social media, which helped Cubans communicate across the country and band together for the islands largest demonstration in decades. Though protests have continued, hundreds of people are likely missing and police have reportedly peppered crowds with bullets to subdue opposition. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead of the Castro regime, responded to the protests by urging ""revolutionaries"" to violently assault unarmed protesters on the streets, describing his call as an ""order of combat,"" Breitbart News reported. In response to Diaz-Canels order, both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers have unleashed a wave of repression on protesters that has included shooting at them, attacking them with dogs, and public beatings. The regime also appeared to shut down internet access to stem the flow of ""citizen journalist videos depicting extreme repression."" "" Yes I do -- we all do,"" Arteaga said at the Naples protest when Breitbart News asked if he still has family in Cuba. Arteaga said he came to the United States when he was 18 years old ""looking for freedom."" Naples, which is two hours across the state from Miami, has a relatively large Cuban population. Many families move to the beachside town in search of a more suburban lifestyle than Miami offers, and most have relatives and friends still in Cuba. ""Its really hard. Some of our families only communicate to us through WhatsApp and Facebook. When the internet shuts down, its really hard to get ahold of them. Thats what they do, they cut down the internet,"" Arteaga said. Arteaga noted that while the pandemic has ravaged an already-faltering healthcare system in Cuba, increased disease, death, and destruction only brought the country to a ""tipping point"" after more than 60 years of abuse. ""People are dying of COVID. People are dying of other conditions and they have to stay at home. They have to keep their dead relatives at home because there are no supplies in the morgues. There are no supplies in the hospitals. The power goes off and the generators in the hospitals dont work and people die,"" he said. ""Everything, infrastructure, everything in Cuba -- its at the lowest limit right now. Thats what were seeing right now, but its always been low. People got tired of it."" President Joe Biden avoided explicitly condemning communism and Marxist ideology in a Monday statement, though he claimed to ""stand with the Cuban people."" Marxism is the philosophical underpinning of communism, the ruling political system in Cuba, and has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people over several decades. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Cuban protesters yelling ""freedom!"" during anti-communist protests could have actually been demanding ""freedom from rising COVID cases."" On Wednesday, Psaki again declined to blame unrest in Cuba on communism, Breitbart News reported. ""People want a new system, a democratic system. We have a dictatorship in Cuba, and we have been having that for years and years,"" Arteaga said. ""Thats why people are protesting in the streets in Cuba, and thats why they are giving their lives in Cuba to the hands of the police and the army. They want a radical change in the government of Cuba."" American corporate media also falsely asserted that the protests were a response to the nations handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic or economic woes, even as protesters were caught on camera saying slogans such as, ""down with communism,"" ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" among other anti-government statements. ""I dont understand why theres been so much silence on the left on this particular point with regard to whats happening. We can talk about the vice president, Kamala Harris, going down to Guatemala and places like that where shes not wanted, supposedly to address the root cause of immigration issues, when we have a humanitarian crisis 45 minutes away from here, and theres been utter silence,"" said Drew-Montez Clark, a U.S. Representative candidate for District 25 in Florida. ""We need to call [communism] for what it is. ... We have the radical left in this country that wants to move toward that authoritarianism. They want to move toward socialism and communism. But we have a perfect example in Cuba of what that turns into,"" Clark continued, as he waved an American flag at the Tuesday protest. Many in the crowd, some who braved dangerous waters in flimsy rafts to escape communism in Cuba, expressed the same concerns about the direction of the United States. ""I would say to all of you: communism sounds pretty when you talk about it if you want to promote it,"" Arteaga said. ""You can read it in a book and it is beautiful,"" Alvarino joined in. ""But in real life, it is suffering. It degrades a society. It oppresses the ones that are not on top, the ones that are not part of the [leadership.],"" Arteaga continued. ""Coming from a communist country, I can tell you, thats the last thing you want for a country like America. Thats what many countries in the world are trying to fight against."" Arteaga said Americans must be very watchful of the government and the culture to make sure communism does not gain a foothold in the United States. ""Dont believe the good things they say about communism. Its not real,"" he concluded. ""This country is beautiful the way it is okay? Dont change it,"" Alvarino added. ""We are working good -- this is the best country in the world. So, God Bless America.""",['Katherine Hamilton'],7/14/2021 22:15,"Cubans Rally in South Florida, Denounce Communism","['system', 'streets', 'rally', 'south', 'florida', 'communism', 'regime', 'protests', 'cuba', 'thats', 'cubans', 'country', 'denounce', 'protesters', 'arteaga']","NAPLES, Florida - Hundreds of Cubans gathered in south Florida on Tuesday to protest -- not the lack of medical supplies in Cuba -- but the brutal communist regime abusing their family and friends back home.

60,https://www.foxnews.com/world/cubas-president-admits-government-shortcomings-some-blame-for-protests,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who days ago called on revolutionaries to counter anti-government protesters in the streets, acknowledged Wednesday government shortcomings in the lead-up to the unrest in the country. Diaz-Canel, who has been widely criticized for the countrys violent crackdown and Internet blackouts, gave a televised address Wednesday night and acknowledged that his government failures played a role in the protests over food shortages and other problems. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" Historic protests broke out across Cuba on Sunday night. Diaz-Canel, who heads the Communist Party, seemed uninterested in making any concessions. He placed the blame squarely on the U.S. for stoking resentment and called the protesters mercenaries. At one point, he said, ""The order to fight has been given--into the street, revolutionaries!"" PITBULL SPEAKS OUT IN SUPPORT OF PROTESTERS Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. Some protesters have demanded a change in government, so although Diaz-Canel seemed to tone down the rhetoric, it remains to be seen if there will be any concessions by the government. CUBAN AMERICAN PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN EXPRESSWAY IN MIAMI, BLAME BIDEN FOR LACK OF SUPPORT The true extent of the countrys crackdown is unclear due to reports of blocked internet access. The New York Times, citing Amnesty International, reported on Tuesday that at least 150 were detained. There were other reports of some protesters being unaccounted for. Diaz-Canel on Wednesday urged Cubans to not act with hate. DEM SOCIALISTS ALSO MUM ON PROTESTS Gov.

61,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-lifts-food-medicine-customs-restrictions-after-protests-2021-07-15/,"People shout slogans against the government during a protest against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo HAVANA, July 14 (Reuters) - Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on the amount of food and medicine travelers could bring into the country in an apparent small concession to demands by protesters who took to the street last weekend. Thousands joined a wave of nationwide protests over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the government's handling of a surge in COVID-19 infections on Sunday, in the most significant unrest in decades in the Communist-run country. The government blamed the unrest on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardship caused by the decades-old U.S. trade embargo that Washington tightened in the midst of the pandemic, pushing the Cuban economy to the brink. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Several countries and the United Nations have called on the government to respect citizens' right to express themselves. Others like Mexico have said the best way to help the Cuban people would be for the United States to ease sanctions. loading In Cuba, a growing number of high-profile artists from salsa band Los Van Van to jazz pianist Chucho Valdes have criticized the authorities handling of the unrest, urging them to listen to protesters rather than fight them. Intermittent internet outages that activists say were designed to tamp any further unrest eased slightly on Wednesday although access to social media and messaging services remained restricted. Officials have blamed a campaign on social media under the hashtag #SOSCuba calling for humanitarian aid for fueling the protests, saying it was launched by U.S.-backed mercenaries seeking to destabilize the Communist-run country. They compared the push to a U.S.-backed effort to send relief to Venezuela in 2019 that ended in a violent standoff on the Colombian border. loading Still, one of the campaign's demands was for the government to lift customs restrictions on food, medicine and hygiene products that are lacking in the country amid its worst economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union. And Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said on Wednesday the government would do precisely that from next Monday, lifting restrictions until the year-end. ""It was a demand made by many travelers and it was necessary to take this decision,"" he said on a roundtable on state television, alongside President Miguel Diaz-Canel. It was not immediately clear how much difference the move would make given that there are very few flights at the moment into the Caribbean island nation which is going through its worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic. Government critic Yoani Sanchez, who runs news website 14ymedio, was quick to tweet that such concessions would not be enough to appease those who had protested on Sunday. ""We do not want crumbs, we want freedom, and we want it nowwwww,"" she wrote. ""The streets have spoken: we are not afraid."" Cubans say they have been frustrated by outages in mobile internet and restricted access to social media and messaging platforms since Sunday. ""It's been a bunch of days that noone has been able to connect,"" said Havana resident Andrea Lopez. ""My husband is in Mexico and I haven't been able to speak with him."" More than 200 people were detained during or following the protests, according to exiled rights group Cubalex, and only a handful have been released so far. Diaz-Canel said there were three kinds of protesters; counter-revolutionaries, criminals and those with legitimate frustrations. State-run television showed images of a crowd looting a store and another attacking an empty police car. Interior ministry officials said in a program televised later that some of the detained would be pursued for crimes like incitement to violence, contempt, robbery and damage to public property, which carry lengthy prison sentences.

62,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/cubas-president-government-blame-protests-78855031,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has acknowledged shortcomings in his governments handling of shortages and of neglecting certain sectors, but he is urging Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to violence during recent street protests HAVANA -- Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Wednesday acknowledged shortcomings in his government's handling of shortages and of neglecting certain sectors, but he urged Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to violence during recent street protests. Until now, the Cuban government had only blamed social media and the U.S. government for the weekend protests, which were the biggest seen in Cuba since a quarter century ago, when then-President Fidel Castro personally went into the streets to calm crowds of thousands furious over dire shortages following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its economic subsidies for the island. In a nighttime address on state television, Diaz-Canel for the first time was self critical and acknowledged that failings by the state played a role in the protests over food shortages, rising prices and other grievances. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" In the protests, many Cubans expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines, as well as repeated electricity outages. Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against the coronavirus. But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades. Police moved in and arrested dozens of protesters, sometimes violently, and the government has accused protesters of looting and vandalizing shops. Smaller protests continued Monday and officials reported at least one death. No incidents were reported Wednesday. ""Our society is not a society that generates hatred and those people acted with hatred,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""The feeling of Cubans is a feeling of solidarity and these people carried out these armed acts, with vandalism ... yelling for deaths ... planning to raid public places, breaking, robbing, throwing stones."" Authorities did not report the number of people arrested, Col. Moraima Bravet of the Interior Ministry said Wednesday only that they are mostly between the ages of 25 and 37 and will be prosecuted such crimes as public disorder, assault, contempt, robbery or damage. Cuba is suffering its worst crisis in years from a combination of the coronavirus pandemic that has paralyzed its economy, including the vital tourism industry, inefficiencies in the state-run economy and the tightening of U.S. sanctions on the island. The administration of President Donald Trump imposed more than 200 measures against the island in four years. Diaz-Canel said that this ""complex situation"" was taken advantage of ""by those who do not really want the Cuban revolution to develop or a civilized relationship with respect with the United States."" Shortly before the presidents remarks, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced some measures such as customs flexibility for Cuban citizens who go on foreign trips to bring home toiletries, food and medicines, which are among the most hard to find items in Cuba. Marrero also said that work is being done to improve the stability of the national electricity system and that officials will seek to improve the supply of medicines, many of which are produced on the island but whose inputs must be imported. Meanwhile, Economy Minister Alejandro Gil announced the directors of state-owned enterprises will be allowed to determine salaries beyond the regulations. He also said that in the coming weeks long-promised rules will be instituted for small- and medium-size enterprises to be formed, a step once unthinkable under the communist government.","['Abc News', 'The Associated Press', 'July']",7/15/2021 3:23,Cuba's president says government has some blame for protests,"['díazcanel', 'president', 'food', 'medicines', 'cuban', 'protests', 'island', 'blame', 'shortages', 'cubans', 'cubas', 'economy']","In a nighttime address on state television, Diaz-Canel for the first time was self critical and acknowledged that failings by the state played a role in the protests over food shortages, rising prices and other grievances.

Demonstrators voiced grievances on Sunday against goods shortages, rising prices and power cuts, and some called for a change of government. (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel for the first time is offering some self-criticism while saying that government shortcomings in handling shortages and other problems played a role in this weeks protests. But in a televised address Wednesday night he also called on Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to the violence that occurred at some of the rare street demonstrations in which protesters voiced grievances over high prices, food shortages and power outages, while some people also called for a change in the government. Until now, the Cuban government had only blamed social media and the U.S. government for the weekend protests, which were the biggest seen in Cuba since a quarter century ago, when then-President Fidel Castro personally went into the streets to calm crowds of thousands furious over dire shortages following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its economic subsidies for the island. ADVERTISEMENT Diaz-Canel, however, said that failings by the state played a role in the unrest. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" In the protests, many Cubans expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines, as well as repeated electricity outages. Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against the coronavirus. But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades. Police moved in and arrested dozens of protesters, sometimes violently, and the government has accused protesters of looting and vandalizing shops. Smaller protests continued Monday and officials reported at least one death. No incidents were reported Wednesday. ""Our society is not a society that generates hatred and those people acted with hatred,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""The feeling of Cubans is a feeling of solidarity and these people carried out these armed acts, with vandalism ... yelling for deaths ... planning to raid public places, breaking, robbing, throwing stones."" Authorities did not report the number of people arrested, Col. Moraima Bravet of the Interior Ministry said Wednesday only that they are mostly between the ages of 25 and 37 and will be prosecuted such crimes as public disorder, assault, contempt, robbery or damage. Cuba is suffering its worst crisis in years from a combination of the coronavirus pandemic that has paralyzed its economy, including the vital tourism industry, inefficiencies in the state-run economy and the tightening of U.S. sanctions on the island. The administration of President Donald Trump imposed more than 200 measures against the island in four years. Diaz-Canel said that this ""complex situation"" was taken advantage of ""by those who do not really want the Cuban revolution to develop or a civilized relationship with respect with the United States."" ADVERTISEMENT Shortly before the presidents remarks, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced some measures such as customs flexibility for Cuban citizens who go on foreign trips to bring home toiletries, food and medicines, which are among the most hard to find items in Cuba. Marrero also said that work is being done to improve the stability of the national electricity system and that officials will seek to improve the supply of medicines, many of which are produced on the island but whose inputs must be imported. Meanwhile, Economy Minister Alejandro Gil announced the directors of state-owned enterprises will be allowed to determine salaries beyond the regulations. He also said that in the coming weeks long-promised rules will be instituted for small- and medium-size enterprises to be formed, a step once unthinkable under the communist government.",[],7/15/2021 4:08,Cuba's leader lays some blame for protests on his government,"['prices', 'voiced', 'called', 'national', 'lays', 'power', 'leader', 'change', 'cuban', 'protests', 'blame', 'shortages', 'cubas', 'protesters']","A truck of special forces police sits parked outside National Capitol building in Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, July 14, 2021, days after protests.

64,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/15/hundreds-of-miamis-sos-cuba-protesters-sing-patria-y-vida-in-little-havana/,"MIAMI - A nostalgic protest song in Spanish reverberated Wednesday night on Miamis Calle Ocho. The lyrics of ""Patria y Vida,"" Spanish for ""Homeland and Life,"" antagonize a more than half-a-century old Cuban government propaganda slogan. The song urging Cubans to ""no longer shout 'Homeland and death! But, 'Homeland and life!"" took a different meaning on the communist island during the coronavirus pandemic. For Cuban Americans, the lyrics had more meaning after the uprising Sunday. SOS Cuba protesters meet Wednesday in Little Havana to watch Gente De Zona, or GDZ, perform a 'Patria Y Vida' song that became the anthem of the Sunday uprising in Cuba. During the free concert in Little Havana, hundreds sang together. Some were in tears. Attendees said it wasnt a party. Some said they participated in the ""exercise on freedom of speech"" after work to speak up for their relatives in Cuba who are being censored with violence. ""It cant remain like this. The United States government has to do something,"" Musician Alexander Delgado said in Spanish. Ad Delgado was standing next to his fellow members of Gente De Zona, Yotuel Omar Manzanarez Romero and Randy Malcom. They produced the song with Maykel ""El Osorbo"" Castillo, and El Funky de Cuba, both members of Havanas The San Isidro Movement against censorship. ""We raised our voices for freedom in Cuba,"" Malcom said in Spanish in a video he published on Instagram after the concert. Members of Gente De Zona, or GDZ, Alexander Delgado, right, Yotuel Omar, center, and Randy Malcom, left, talk to Local 10 News Reporter Christian De La Rosa Wednesday in Miami's Little Havana. (Copyright 2020 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.) Others at the event said they wanted to remind U.S. officials that there are Americans of Cuban descent who want the U.S. to intervene because Cubans need political change. Estefani Moncada held up a ""No More Communism"" sign that she made at home and said she trusts God and ""the good people"" will help Cubans. Ad ""I trust the president that we have. I didnt vote for him but I trust him,"" Moncada said. Opposition leaders on the island report some Cubans with COVID are dying at home without access to healthcare. Cuban Americans said their relatives are dealing with shortages of food and medicine, power outages, old pipes that pollute the water, and an authoritarian regime that uses trained special forces units to brutally arrest protesters at their homes.

65,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-defends-cuba-policy-official-rubio-criticism,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The State Department defended its head of Cuba policy, saying both the U.S. and Cuba are better for her service despite Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., claiming she was responsible for the Biden administration's ""weak"" response to how the Cuban government is treating its people. In a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Rubio called on President Biden to take charge by leading the international community in pressuring the Cuban government to ease its crackdown on protesters. The senator called the administration's response ""weak"" thus far, and asserted that this would not change as long as the current lead official on Cuba policy - Deputy Assistant Secretary Emily Mendrala - is in charge. BLACK LIVES MATTER BLAMES US, PRAISES CUBAN REGIME, SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS The State Department responded with a full-throated endorsement of Mendrala and her capabilities. ""Deputy Assistant Secretary Mendrala has years of experience - at the State Department, White House, and on Capitol Hill -- working to support human rights and advance the cause of democracy in Cuba,"" the State Department said. ""The American and Cuban people are better off because of her continued public service."" CUBA'S PRESIDENT ADMITS TO SHORTCOMINGS; TAKES SOME BLAME FOR PROTESTS Rubio said Mendrala's history includes ""supporting engagement"" with Cuba, including planning trips for members of Congress to meet members of the Cuban government. Mendrala's State Department bio confirms she has ""led educational travel delegations"" to Cuba for members of Congress and others. Rubio, who is Cuban American, has been a vocal supporter of the protesters as they face retaliation from their own government. On Wednesday, he called on Biden to help Cubans by authorizing funding for emergency internet connectivity, as the government has restricted internet access for its people in response to the protests. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Florida Republican also called for Biden to convene the Organization of American States and the United Nations in order to collectively pressure Cuba to cease its actions against its people.",['Ronn Blitzer'],7/15/2021 9:57,State Department defends Cuba policy official after Rubio blames her for admin's 'weak' response,"['state', 'policy', 'called', 'rubio', 'biden', 'cuban', 'department', 'mendrala', 'members', 'cuba', 'weak', 'official', 'defends', 'american', 'response', 'blames']","The State Department defended its head of Cuba policy, saying both the U.S. and Cuba are better for her service despite Sen.

66,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cubas-president-blasting-us-embargo-takes-blame-protests-rcna1429,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel insisted on blaming the United States and an embargo he calls ""genocidal"" for the huge protests that recently gripped the island, but also recognized that his government was partly to blame. ""We also have to make a critical analysis of our own problems so we can act, so we can overcome, and prevent them from repeating themselves, so we can transform situations,"" Diaz-Canel said during a speech on Wednesday. He also doubled down on previous comments about the protests being orchestrated by the United States. He said the U.S. embargo limits what they can achieve and called it ""cruel"" and ""genocidal."" Some of those who participated, he said, ""respond to a foreign plan, that are irreconcilably against the Cuban revolution, and dont think like Cubans. They think under the guises of the empire,"" he said, referring to the United States. He said other groups that were involved in the protests included ""delinquents, ""unsatisfied people"" and ""young people."" Cuba's prime minister, Manuel Marrero, who also spoke Wednesday, said that starting Monday until the end of the year, the government would lift restrictions on the amount of food and medicine that travelers are allowed to bring into the country. This had been a demand on social media among many Cubans using the hashtag #SOSCuba before the protests erupted. However, Cuba has limited the amount of flights to Cuba, particularly from the United States, in an attempt to reduce the amount of Covid-19 infections circulating on the island. The island has been grappling with a record number of cases and deaths recently. Thousands spontaneously took to the streets Sunday that have caught the attention of the world after decades of relatively little or no unrest. The lifting of restrictions on food and medicine is a small step considering the demands that protesters have been making, including calls for an end to over 60 years of communist rule. Diaz-Canel said Wednesday that the country lacked a ""tremendous amount of hard currency so we always have an enormous list of what the country needs."" The tipping point for many Cubans was the dire economic crisis they are facing that includes acute shortages in food and medicine, increasing prices due to inflation, and 12-hour blackouts in the sweltering heat. Among the many chants Cubans could be heard demanding ""freedom,"" ""we want change,"" and ""homeland and life."" Police cracked down on protests that had carried over to Monday, while authorities blocked social media and messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. On Wednesday people were beginning to access these apps again. Internationally, calls from human rights groups, the United Nations, and several countries have grown louder, demanding Cubas government to be more tolerant of demonstrations and for police to use less force. Cubans living abroad in Spain, Mexico and other countries have broken out into protests and rallies in support of their relatives back home. At a protest rally in Miami on Wednesday, the heart of the exile community, the group Gente de Zona performed their song ""Patria y Vida"" or ""Homeland and Life"" that has become a sort of anthem for those in Cuba demanding liberty. The title of the song is a play on the socialist revolutionary slogan ""patria or muerte"" or ""homeland or death"" that Cubans grew up with.

67,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/15/w-h-o-susidiary-discourages-cuba-protests-over-coronavirus/,"The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), the Americas subsidiary of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), discouraged anti-communist protests in Cuba in a statement Wednesday, claiming they elevate the risk of spreading Chinese coronavirus. PAHOs statement appeared to contradict the W.H.O.s active support of riots in the United States throughout summer 2020 in response to alleged racism in the country. At the time, W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded to mass assemblies of people, many of them violent, by asserting that his agency ""fully supports equality and the global movement against racism."" Unlike in summer 2020, however, many countries of the world now have access to experimental vaccines, many of which have shown a significant ability to limit the spread of Chinese coronavirus. The Cuban communist regime claims to have two vaccine candidates in advanced development and began pediatric clinical trials for one of them, the ""Abdala"" experiment, on Thursday. PAHO is currently embroiled in legal litigation over its ties to the Castro regime. Cuban slave doctors forced to work in Brazil sued the agency in 2018 for signing onto an agreement between Cuba and the then-socialist government of Brazil to ship hundreds of doctors to the country. The doctors did not receive payments for their work, they alleged, and the Castro regime forced them to engage in espionage and communist agitation. PAHO signing onto the agreement prevented conservative lawmakers in Brazil from rejecting it and offered a shield to the Brazilian government should the United States take measures in response to Brazil enriching an enemy state. Thousands of Cubans began taking the streets of the island nations biggest cities on Sunday, flooding as many as 60 municipalities across the country with peaceful marches demanding an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. Authorities responded to the protests with violent repression that included reports of opening fire on crowds of protesters, beating them publicly, and, later, door-to-door raids shooting people in their homes and dragging them out to unknown locations. Protests reportedly continued into Wednesday, but Cuban government officials cut off access to social media, making it difficult for citizens to share videos and other images of the protests and corresponding repression. ""The agglomeration of people in protests over political, religious, cultural, or sports reasons increase the risk of transmission and especially if, as in the case of Cuba, there is active transmission in many places around the country,"" PAHOs emergencies director Ciro Ugarte scolded on Wednesday. Ugarte noted that in Matanzas province, east of Havana, doctors claim to have identified the Indian variant of the virus known as ""Delta,"" which is allegedly fueling an ""exponential"" rise in cases. Matanzas has experienced some of the largest protests and most violent police response. Ugartes tone differs from how the W.H.O. responded to the outburst of violent riots around the United States a year ago. ""WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds,"" W.H.O. chief Tedros said in June 2020. ""We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest."" Tedros statement occurred at a time when Cuba was still not experiencing any significant number of cases, but the Castro regime was nonetheless acting in ways that could facilitate the spread of the virus. The Cuban government began actively courting tourism in spring 2020 in response to much of the world locking down and restricting travel, hoping to take financial advantage of the diminution in competition for tourists. The first known cases of Chinese coronavirus in Cuba were documented in Italian tourists from Lombardy, at the time one of the regions with the highest rates of infection in the world. PAHOs discouragement of expressions against the Castro regime recalls its own questionable relationship with the communist government. In 2018, the Spanish online newspaper Diario de Cuba obtained government documents that revealed PAHO to be a party in the creation of Brazils ""Mais Medicos"" program, created by corrupt socialist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to import Cuban slave doctors and enrich the Castro regime. The documents showed that the Brazilian government agreed to pay salaries to the Cuban doctors - revealing the socialists claims that they were aware doctors would only receive meager academic ""stipends"" to be a lie - and that PAHOs involvement allowed Lula to go forward with the plan without consulting the Brazilian Congress, which may have opposed it given the large number of native Brazilian doctors the country counts on. President Jair Bolsonaro, who ended ""Mais Medicos,"" accused the Cuban government of using doctors to build espionage networks in countries that purchased them. Bolsonaro has offered political asylum to any Cuban doctor seeking to defect in recognition that the Cuban regime punishes defectors by banning them from coming home for at least eight years. A group of doctors who escaped the slave program sued PAHO in U.S. court following the revelation of those documents. In November, a U.S. federal court rejected PAHOs attempt to dismiss the lawsuit; it remains ongoing today. Experts estimate that the Castro regime makes about $11 billion a year selling slave doctors to allied countries.

Thousands took to the streets across the island nation last weekend to protest chronic shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the government's handling of a worsening coronavirus outbreak, marking the most significant unrest in decades. The rare wave of demonstrations against the country's communist government has been fanned by a deepening economic crisis worsened by the pandemic. Covid-19 has devastated the country's tourism industry, sending Cuba's economy into a deep slump. People take part in an anti-government demonstration in Havana on July 11. Cubans now spend hours in long lines to buy food and medicine, and lockdowns have left many without work. Driven by desperate conditions, migration is on the rise by both land and sea. Since the start of the 2021 fiscal year, the US Coast Guard reported intercepting around 500 Cubans at sea. In a country known for repressing dissent, the demonstrations have been viewed as remarkable. US President Joe Biden on Monday expressed support for the Cuban people, urging Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel's regime to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement.

MUST WATCH 'Their revolution really has ended in a tragedy' 17:18 In the aftermath of the protests, anti-government activists say that more than 100 people have been detained or are missing in a crackdown described as the largest in years. The US, Canada and the European Union have condemned the arrests of political activists and journalists, demanding their immediate release. ""The Cuban Government has attempted to silence their [Cubans] voices and communications through internet shutdowns, violence, and arbitrary detentions of dozens of protesters, journalists, activists, and other repressive tactics,"" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday, calling on the Cuban government to release anyone detained for peaceful protest. A line to buy food in Havana, on February 2, 2021. President Diaz-Canel blamed the unrest on vandals and criminals, and denied police had used excessive force against protesters. But, days later, he conceded that the government needed to do more to improve living conditions in poorer neighborhoods that had been rocked by the demonstrations. On Sunday, CNN journalists witnessed multiple people being forcibly arrested and thrown in the back of vans at protests in Havana. Videos of the protest showed demonstrators turning over a police car and throwing rocks at officers. The Cuban government has not said how many people were arrested or injured in the protests. Diaz-Canel said he didn't know the exact figure, but said ""tens of people"" had been injured. In San Antonio de los Banos, a city of about 46,000 people west of Havana, hundreds of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday, fed up after nearly a week of electricity cuts during the sweltering July heat. ""Everyone was in the streets,"" one resident, who did not want to be named, told CNN. ""They have gone six days with only 12 hours of power each day. That was one of the things that blew this up."" Anti-government protesters march in Havana on Sunday. On Wednesday evening, the Cuban government announced it would lift restrictions on food and medicine travelers could bring into the country -- a small concession for demonstrators. Custom duties on these products will not need to be paid, and the relaxed measures will stay in place for the rest of the year. The Cuban government blames its economic woes on the US trade sanctions, which restricts its access to imports and financing. In a recent nationally televised address, Diaz-Canel repeated that criticism and urged his supporters to physically confront protesters. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance on Sunday. ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets.""","['Patrick Oppmann', 'Eliza Mackintosh']",7/15/2021 12:43,Cuba lifts customs restrictions on food and medicine after biggest protests in decades,"['biggest', 'díazcanel', 'havana', 'streets', 'food', 'decades', 'restrictions', 'journalists', 'lifts', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'customs', 'economic', 'medicine', 'demonstrators']","Havana (CNN) Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on travelers bringing food, medicines and hygiene products into the country in an apparent acknowledgment of demands from anti-government demonstrators .

69,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/15/cuban-american-protesters-take-to-streets-of-miami-lakes/,"Drivers honked their horns in support of the Cuban-Americans protesting Thursday morning at the intersection of Northwest 154th Street and Northwest 82nd Avenue in Miami Lakes as the protesters demanded freedom for the Cuban people. MIAMI LAKES, Fla. - Gov. Ron DeSantis made an appearance in South Florida Thursday, alongside other leaders from Miami-Dade County, to call on the Biden administration to help restore internet access to Cuba. ""The one thing communists fear the most is the truth,"" the governor said. Authorities in Cuba blocked social media sites earlier this week in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation. Restricting internet access has become a tried-and-true method of stifling dissent by authoritarian regimes around the world, alongside government-supported disinformation campaigns and propaganda. DeSantis said it wont be an overnight fix, but said the U.S. is capable of helping restore internet access on the island. #BREAKING: @POTUS is considering tech to help reinstate internet access in #Cuba. Adds hes not reinstating remittances bc he has no faith #Cuban government wont confiscate them. Would also be open to sending vaccines, using third party organization. @WPLGLocal10 #sosCuba -- Hatzel Vela (@HatzelVelaWPLG) July 15, 2021 REPLAY: Gov. Ron DeSantis, other leaders hold news conference in Miami amid Cuba protests Ad Earlier in the morning, drivers honked their horns in support of the Cuban-Americans who were protesting at the intersection of Northwest 154th Street and Northwest 82nd Avenue in Miami Lakes as the protesters demanded freedom for the Cuban people. ""Weve suffered for so long and we are here to represent our families and everyone who is still stuck in Cuba who has not been able to have at least the basic necessities of life,"" protest organizer Vanessa Wong said. DeSantis on Thursday praised protesters for remaining peaceful, but said blocking roads and highways, which happened Tuesday on the Palmetto Expressway, will not be tolerated. ""We cant have that,"" he said. But many say the governor is not backing up his words as the Florida Highway Patrol let the busy highway shut down on Tuesday, even though troopers blocked Black Lives Matter protesters from getting on I-95 last year. Ad No arrests were made in either incident. During Thursdays protest in Miami Lakes, no roadways were blocked by demonstrators. ""Its time that we seek a change and we ask for help from our representatives,"" Wong said. The rally comes a day after protesters in Miami marched for 5 miles in a demonstration of unity toward the civil unrest in Cuba. ""Whats going on on the island is really bad,"" one man said. ""If people go online and look for it, youre going to see (it) all. Theyre pulling kids out of houses, how theyre beating up people in the street for no reason."" Gov. Ron DeSantis says protesters in solidarity with Cuba should not block traffic, but praises law enforcement for not arresting anyone despite his own anti-riot bill. Demonstrators on Wednesday began their march at Cafe Versailles in Little Havana. They ended up downtown at the Freedom Tower, a landmark considered the ""Ellis Island of the South"" for its role in the 1960s and 1970s as the U.S. Cuban Assistance Center, which offered relief to refugees who sought political asylum from Fidel Castros regime. Ad ""This is the Freedom Tower, and it represents freedom,"" one man said. ""Most of the people, when they first came here, when the first exiles (came) in the 60s, this is where they came. This is where they came to get their paperwork and stuff done."" Activists say Cubans are tired of the communist-run government and want political change. Theyre dealing with shortages of food, medicine and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as power outages and internet connection problems amid a worsening economy. At the FTX Arena, theres an electronic sign that says ""Libertad,"" which means ""freedom,"" and #SOSCuba, which is the hashtag that protesters both here in South Florida and in Cuba have been using on Twitter in a desperate plea for humanitarian intervention. The Brickell Run Club will be hosting a three-mile run for Cuba at 7 p.m. Friday starting at the Bay of Pigs monument in Little Havana.","['Madeleine Wright', 'Amanda Batchelor']",7/15/2021 14:09,DeSantis calls on Biden to help restore internet access to Cuba as protesters continue to take to streets of South Florida,"['streets', 'south', 'lakes', 'desantis', 'access', 'florida', 'help', 'internet', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'freedom', 'continue', 'northwest', 'came', 'miami', 'restore', 'protesters']","MIAMI LAKES, Fla. - Gov.

70,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-communism-failed-ideology-historic-cuba-protests,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The White House called communism a ""failed ideology"" Thursday, saying President Biden ""stands with"" the people of Cuba and their ""call for freedom."" Amid historic protests in the island country, White House press secretary Jen Psaki affirmed that the Biden administration supports Cuban protesters and their ""call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of repression and economic suffering to which theyve been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime."" BIDEN PRAISES CUBAN PROTESTERS AFTER CUBA PRESIDENT ACCUSES US OF FUNDING DEMONSTRATORS ""There is an ongoing review of our own policies, and as we look at those policies, one of the big factors is ensuring that we are not doing anything to pad the pockets of a corrupt, authoritarian regime,"" Psaki said, adding that the White House is looking closely at ways to ""help in a humanitarian way"" to ""support the voices of the Cuban people."" Psaki went on to call communism a ""failed ideology."" ""We certainly believe that it has failed the people of Cuba,"" Psaki said. ""They deserve freedom, they deserve a government that supports them - whether that is making sure they have health and medical supplies, access to vaccines, or whether they have economic opportunity and prosperity instead - this has been a government, an authoritarian, communist regime that has repressed its people and has failed the people of Cuba."" Psaki went on to note the ""ideology of the government, which has failed, and has led to a failure, a lack of access to economic opportunity, to medical supplies, to COVID vaccines"" are all reasons for the historic protests. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who days ago called on revolutionaries to counter anti-government protesters in the streets, acknowledged on Wednesday night government shortcomings in the lead-up to the unrest in the country. Diaz-Canel, who has been widely criticized for the countrys violent crackdown and internet blackouts, gave a televised address Wednesday night and acknowledged that his government failures played a role in the protests over food shortages and other problems. CUBAN PRESIDENT URGES COUNTRY'S 'REVOLUTIONARY CITIZENS TO COUNTER PROTESTS ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" Historic protests broke out across Cuba on Sunday night. Diaz-Canel, who heads the Communist Party, seemed uninterested in making any concessions. He placed the blame squarely on the U.S. for stoking resentment and called the protesters mercenaries. At one point, he said, ""The order to fight has been given--into the street, revolutionaries!"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cuba is facing its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. Some protesters have demanded a change in government, so although Diaz-Canel seemed to tone down the rhetoric, it remains to be seen if there will be any concessions by the government.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials pressed the White House on Thursday to support efforts to preserve internet service to antigovernment protesters in Cuba, even advocating the use of giant balloons as floating Wi-Fi hotspots to allow images of dissent to stream unabated from the authoritarian nation. Cuban authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the country after thousands of Cubans began taking to the streets last weekend to protest limited access to COVID-19 vaccines and basic goods. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in decades. ""We obviously have to stand with the people of Cuba against the communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said at a press conference in Miami, adding that restoring access to the internet is vital to supporting the people of Cuba. President Joe Biden responded later Thursday by denouncing communism and saying his administration is assessing whether it has the technology to maintain internet access for Cubans. ADVERTISEMENT Internet access was restored in Cuba earlier this week, but, as of Thursday, cellphone data was still not fully restored. The protests in the island nation have sparked an outpouring of support in Florida, which is home to the nations largest community of Cuban exiles. Throngs of people in Miami, Orlando and the Tampa area have rallied in support, sometimes shutting down major thoroughfares. DeSantis said every option should be explored, including using offshore and satellite technology to supply internet service. One option being considered is using balloons to provide connectivity. The Republican governor also suggested using the U.S. Embassy in Havana as a kind of hotspot. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth. And if were able to help Cubans communicate with one another -- also communicate to the outside world -- that truth is going to matter,"" DeSantis said. ""And so, Mr. President, nows the time to stand up and be counted."" Its unclear how the U.S. government or any other entity, public or private, might keep internet service uninterrupted. ""We need the political willingness from the Biden administration,"" said Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, whose parents were Cuban exiles. ""And if the federal government considers that they cannot pay for the resources, the Cuban American community will."" On Thursday evening, Biden denounced Cuba as a ""failed state"" that is ""repressing their citizens"" and called communism ""a universally failed system"" during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Biden said that the U.S. is considering ways to help Cubans -- as long as that aid is not undermined by the communist government. ADVERTISEMENT Biden said the administration wont ease a ban on remittances to Cubans because they believe ""it is highly likely the regime would confiscate"" them, and that while the U.S. is prepared to send ""significant amounts"" of a COVID-19 vaccine to the country, theyd have to be administered by an international organization in such a way that average citizens could get them. ""Theyve cut off access to the internet -- were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access,"" Biden said. Meanwhile, demonstrations in Florida continued for another day. Hundreds were gathering in Hialeah near Miami to show solidarity with Cubans. Earlier in the week, two Florida men were arrested during a protest in Tampa in support of the demonstrations and were held on charges related to the states new so-called anti-riot law. Julian Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 30, Maikel Vazquez-Pico, 39, were among those arrested Tuesday night as a group of protesters attempted to take over an exit ramp at Interstate 275 and Dale Mabry Highway, which is a major thoroughfare in Tampa. Both were arrested on charges that include battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting law enforcement and taking part in an unlawful assembly that blocked streets or sidewalks, records show. Rodriguez-Rodriguez put an officer into a bear hug as the officer was trying to arrest another protester, according to an arrest report. He then punched an officer in the face, breaking his glasses as the officer tried to arrest him, the report said. He continued to resist arrest until he was placed in handcuffs. The men were being held without bond in the Hillsborough County Jail early Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether either had an attorney who could comment. Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into law a Florida bill that boosts penalties against demonstrators who turn violent and creates new criminal penalties for those who organize demonstrations that get out of hand. Provisions of the law also make it a felony to block some roadways and give immunity to people who drive through protesters blocking a road. The bill was introduced after last summers protests for racial justice during which some Black Lives Matter protesters were met by police with tear gas and arrests when they took to the streets for days at a time. During his Thursday press conference, DeSantis again sought to differentiate recent protests over Cuba from those last year. ""Cuban Americans who are out demonstrating,"" he said, ""theyre not violent riots. Theyre out there being peaceful and theyre making their voices heard, and we support them."" But he said demonstrators should not be shutting down roads that could impede traffic and commerce. ___ Calvan reported from St. Petersburg, Florida. Frisaro reported from Fort Lauderdale.

""And so, Mr. President, nows the time to stand up and be counted.""Its unclear how the U.S. government or any other entity, public or private, might keep internet service uninterrupted.

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on Wednesday urged President Joe Biden to step forward and assist in providing internet access to the people of Cuba, who have taken to the streets in protest of the oppressive, communist regime, prompting the dictatorship to shut down the internet to silence citizens. ""I write to urge you to assist in providing Internet access to the people of Cuba standing up against communist oppression and demanding a voice after decades of suffering under the yoke of a cruel dictatorship,"" the Florida governor wrote in the July 14 letter, detailing the demonstrations which have seen thousands protesting the brutal authoritarian regime: I urge President Biden to assist in providing internet access to the people of Cuba standing up against communist oppression and demanding a voice after decades of suffering under a cruel dictatorship.https://t.co/fjSKNxuchW pic.twitter.com/br4iPHZ4k1 -- Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) July 14, 2021 ""At first, the world could see the images and videos of this mass movement, but now the tyrannical regime of President Miguel Diaz-Canel has shut off access to the Internet,"" he said, explaining the Cuban people have lost their ability to communicate with each other. Many Floridians who were born in Cuba, he continued, ""have no information on the safety of their loved ones."" ""Equally as important, the world has also lost the ability to see what is happening on the ground as the Cuban people rise in support of freedom,"" he continued, urging the Biden administration to take action: Technology exists to provide Internet access into Cuba remotely, using the innovation of American enterprise and the diverse industries here. Similar to the American efforts to broadcast radio into the Soviet Union during the Cold War in Europe, the federal government has a history of supporting the dissemination of information into Cuba for the Cuban people through Radio & Television Marti, located in Miami. In addition to sending information, however, our efforts must include creating a means for the Cuban people to speak to the world. I urge you to act immediately to provide all necessary authorizations, indemnifications, and funding to American businesses with the capability to provide Internet access for the people of Cuba. Steps must be taken immediately. ""Internet access for the Cuban people is of critical importance as they stand up against the repressive Communist government,"" DeSantis continued. ""In the hands of these brave individuals, such access may be the key to finally bringing democracy to the island."" Indeed, Cubas state-run telecom monopoly ETECSA restricted access to key social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Telegram, this week as part of its effort to silence citizens: Confirmed: Social media and messaging platforms restricted in #Cuba from Monday on state-run internet provider ETECSA; real-time network data corroborate reports of internet disruptions amid widening anti-government protests; incident ongoing #CubaSOS https://t.co/7eGwPS1Mqf pic.twitter.com/kY3G1qMAse -- NetBlocks (@netblocks) July 12, 2021 ""The targeted restrictions are likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba following widespread protests on Sunday [July 11] as thousands rallied against the socialist government,"" the London-based internet monitor Neblocks surmised.",['Hannah Bleau'],7/15/2021 15:03,DeSantis to Biden: Assist in Providing Internet Access to the Cuban People,"['information', 'desantis', 'access', 'urge', 'biden', 'providing', 'cuban', 'internet', 'communist', 'world', 'cuba', 'provide', 'assist']","Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on Wednesday urged President Joe Biden to step forward and assist in providing internet access to the people of Cuba, who have taken to the streets in protest of the oppressive, communist regime, prompting the dictatorship to shut down the internet to silence citizens.

73,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/15/venezuelan-socialist-leader-cuba-protests-actually-euro-cup-celebrations/,"Diosdado Cabello, the head of Venezuelas ruling socialist party, stated during a press conference this week that the protests in Cuba do not exist and the footage of them widely broadcast throughout international media is, in reality, Italian fans celebrating the nations Euro Cup victory. Cabello is one of Venezuelas most powerful socialist leaders and widely believed to be the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a multinational cocaine trafficking syndicate. He also hosts a state television propaganda show, Con el Mazo Dando (""Hitting with the Mallet""). Cuban people began nationwide street protests on Sunday demanding an end to the communist regime. Thousands of people have taken the streets since, and reports indicate protests are ongoing as of Thursday in nearly every major city in the country. The Communist Party responded to the protests by issuing an ""order of combat"" demanding that loyalists violently attack anyone considered a dissident if seen on the street. As of Wednesday, thousands are believed to be in police custody or missing for participating in the protests. Despite the Castro regime openly acknowledging that protests are ongoing and blaming them on the United States, Cabello made the case during a press conference on Tuesday that no such assemblies had happened, calling the protests a ""media creation."" ""What happened on social media had nothing to do with reality,"" Cabello said. ""People [were] celebrating the Euro Cup and they put that photo out there as if it were happening in Cuba."" Cabello also claimed that some of the many images of Cubans protesting in clearly identifiable cities within Cuba were Argentines celebrating their victory in the Copa America, the South American equivalent of the Euro Cup. Both are soccer tournaments governed by the regional bodies overseen by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). ""It was in Argentina they were celebrating the America Cup, they took the photo from far away and, with no shame whatsoever, saying 'look at Cuba how it is,"" Cabello claimed: ""Era gente que estaba celebrando la Eurocopa"", se burlo Diosdado Cabello, numero 2 del entorno de Nicolas Maduro, quien expreso su apoyo al regimen cubano. #TodoEstaenLN. pic.twitter.com/QLqi33mPcR -- Diario La Nacion (@LaNacionPy) July 14, 2021 Cabello then repeated what has become the default far-left argument against the protests: the true cause of all suffering in Cuba is not 62 years of communist repression, but mild economic sanctions imposed on Cuba by the United States. ""They dont understand that its 60 years of a blockade for them to now think that five tweets from five influences are going to end the Cuban Revolution,"" Cabello said, offering the Venezuelan regimes ""solidarity, our support, our affection, our respect to the Cuban people and their government for the immense struggle they are undergoing."" Cabellos remarks joined a growing list of far-left South American socialists weighing in to defend the Castro regime. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the former president of Brazil, issued a statement on Twitter dismissing the protests as indistinguishable from protests against leaders in democratic societies. Lulas administration was closely tied to the Castro regime and invested heavily in Cubas slave doctor fundraising system. ""Is what is happening in Cuba so special to be talking so much about it?"" Lula asked on Twitter. ""There was a march. I even saw the president of Cuba at the march, talking to people."" Lula appeared to be referring to Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead president of the Castro regime, organizing a small government-mandated counterprotest on Sunday. ""Im tired of seeing protests against Lula, against [former Brazilian president] Dilma [Rousseff], against Trump ... people protest,"" Lula continued, adding that were it not for U.S. sanctions on Cuba, the country ""would be a Holland"" and that violence against black Cubans on the part of the police, unlike in America, was not happening. The same day Lula made these remarks, a video surfaced from Cardenas, Matanzas, Cuba, showing police beating and shooting a man in his home, in front of his twin two-year-olds, and dragging him away, leaving a pool of blood. The man was later identified as Daniel Cardenas, a black man who had marched peacefully on Sunday. While Latin American socialists - and American far-left groups - have banded behind the Castro regime, the administration of President Joe Biden has done little in response to the protests, urging the regime to listen to the protesters but failing to condemn communism for its role in creating the dire circumstances in which the vast majority of Cubans live. The Biden administration has repeatedly claimed that the protests are a response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested this week that Cuban protesters chanting ""freedom"" were actually calling for ""freedom from COVID [Chinese coronavirus],"" not freedom from communism. The Biden administration lifted sanctions on Venezuelas oil industry Monday, despite Venezuelas close economic ties to the Castro regime. The new rules allow ""all transactions and activities related to the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, of liquefied petroleum gas to Venezuela,"" giving a lifeline to the state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Sanctions on individual Venezuelan socialist regime leaders, including Diosdado Cabello, remain in vigor.

Diaz-Canels comments come as the Cuban government also made some concessions to allow more food and medicines to enter the country, NBC News reported Thursday. ""We also have to make a critical analysis of our own problems so we can act, so we can overcome and prevent from repeating themselves, so we can transform situations,"" the president said in a speech Wednesday. Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero also announced that as of Monday, Cuba will lift restrictions on the number of goods, primarily food and medical supplies, that can be brought into the country by foreign travelers, NBC said. Riot police walk the streets after a demonstration against the government of President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on July 12, 2021. AFP via Getty Images That move will remain in place until the end of the year, Marrero said. Thousands took to the streets Sunday amid food and COVID-19 vaccine shortages in the largest demonstration against the Communist regime in decades. The Cuban government, which continues to blame the US for inciting the protesters, cracked down on Monday, arresting dozens and revealing that at least one man was killed during clashes with security forces.

Fernandez, known to fans as Dina Star, went back online late Wednesday to report that she had been arrested for prompting protests but was released unharmed.

At a news conference in Miami, DeSantis said the U.S. government should take action to boost Cubans' access to the internet and consider using the American embassy in Havana as a staging ground. Ideas suggested by some U.S. politicians include using satellite-based networks or high-altitude balloons to enable internet access in Cuba. ""Time is of the essence here. Every day that the regime has to black out the truth is a day they can get the upper hand on this,"" DeSantis said of the Cuban government.

Menendez told MSNBC on Tuesday that ""we should be looking at how we can expand access to the internet, considering satellite feed of internet so that people in the island can communicate with each other."" Satellite-based services would require some physical infrastructure in Cuba, U.S. officials said. ""It isn't as easy of just moving a satellite and all of sudden it just goes straight to the devices,"" DeSantis said. Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, said on Thursday in Miami that ""this is not a technological problem. We have the technology today that can begin to be deployed to provide connectivity into the island.""

76,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-has-contingency-plans-if-it-faces-mass-migration-by-sea-cuba-official-2021-07-15/,"WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday the United States is prepared to send vaccines to Cuba if it is assured an international organization would administer them but he is not considering easing U.S. policy around sending remittances to the country. Thousands of Cubans on Sunday staged the biggest anti-government protests in decades to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Dozens of activists were detained. ""I'd be prepared to give significant amounts of vaccine, if in fact I was assured an international organization would administer those vaccines,"" Biden told reporters during a press conference after his meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register With regard to remittances, or payments Americans can make to their families in Cuba, Biden said he is not going to do that now. Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually and represent Cuba's third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism. ""It is highly likely that the regime would confiscate those remittances or a big chunk of it,"" he said, while calling Cuba a ""failed state"" that is ""repressing their citizens."" Biden also said the White House is reviewing whether the United States can help Cubans regain internet access after Cuba's government restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook (FB.O) and WhatsApp amid the protests. read more On a separate call on Thursday, a senior Biden administration official said the United States has contingency plans and a ""robust presence"" in the Florida Straits if it has to deal with any increased flow of migrants fleeing Cuba by sea. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, reiterated U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' admonition for Cuban migrants not to head for U.S. shores and said a senior Cuban official's threat of ""mass migration"" reflects ""a lack of care for the lives of Cubans who would risk their lives."" A vintage car passes by in front of the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, January 12, 2017. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The U.S. official said the protests ""will obviously have an impact on how we proceed"" with a review of Cuba policy that was launched soon after President Joe Biden took office in January. ""We saw that when we came in that the Cuban regime was actually cracking down much more on the population and that was having a bearing on how we were actually analyzing some of the possible policy responses,"" the official told reporters on a conference call. The official said the administration was looking at revising policy with an eye toward helping the Cuban people, not the government of the Communist-ruled island. But the official stopped short of providing specifics or a timeframe for finishing the review, which had raised hopes of re-engagement with Havana after former President Donald Trump rolled back much of the Obama-era detente between the old Cold War enemies. Before the protests, Biden's aides had been looking at a range of options, including easing the flow of remittances to Cuba and authorizing more family travel. Also under consideration has been whether to lift the designation of Cuba as a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" a label Trump gave to Havana days prior to leaving office. The official declined to say whether Cuba would be removed from the list but said Cuba's designation placed a ""statutory restriction"" on some of the other policy options. Asked about the prospects for mass migration from Cuba, the official said: ""We are actually urging people not to migrate."" Cuban migrants are largely flocking to the U.S.-Mexico land border, not the U.S. coast. And in a sharp break from his predecessor, Biden has been letting most in pending the outcome of their asylum applications, according to government data.

77,https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/biden-facing-pressure-from-all-sides-to-respond-to-cuba-protests/,"President Biden is facing mounting political pressure to respond to the anti-government protests breaking out across Cuba, with Republicans urging the administration to take a stronger stance in support of the protesters, and some Democrats calling on the president to seize on the upheaval for a political opportunity. Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida -- both Cuban Americans -- have led the criticism against the Biden administrations handling of the growing unrest on the Caribbean island. C ruz  hit the Biden administration and White House press secretary Jen Psaki for saying Cubans are protesting the ""mismanagement"" by the government. ""The people protesting in the streets in Cuba are not protesting 'mismanagement.  I f you listen to what theyre chanting,  t heyre not chanting   manage better.   Theyre chanting   libertad.   Theyre chanting   freedom.    T heyre chanting down with the dictatorship ,"" Cruz said on Fox News. President Joe Biden is facing political pressure from both parties to respond to the anti-government protests breaking out across Cuba. REUTERS/Leah Millis ""But for whatever rea son  J oe Biden  and Kamala Harris are unwilling to speak plainly and to say the communist dictatorship in Cuba is evil ,"" he added.   During Thursdays White House press briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki declared that ""Communism was a failed ideology, and we certainly believe that it has failed the people of Cuba."" ""They deserve freedom,"" Psaki added before going on to say that Biden had ""made clear that he stands with the Cuban people and their call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of repression and economic suffering to which theyve been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the Cuban protesters are fed up with decades of ""socialist tyranny "" and deserve US support.  ""Theyve had enough of a regime thats stolen their dreams for decades, theyve had enough of its stranglehold on information and on prosperity, theyve had enough of its intimidation and its repression,""  McConnell said in a Senate floor speech on Thursday. He then accused Democrats of ""running interference for the Cuban regime."" People attend a pro-government rally in Havana, Cuba, July 11, 2021. EPA/Ernesto Mastrascusa ""  Some naive Americans on the left seem intent on once again running interference for the Cuban regime. They still buy the propaganda that Cuba is a socialist paradise, with a model health care and education system that we should actually emulate ,"" the Kentucky Republican said.    Rubio urged the Biden White House to take a more forceful approach to the situation and reach out to the United Nations and the Organization of American States, to get the international community to condemn and isolate Cubas government for its actions -- or face the consequences. ""A horrific bloodbath is what awaits if action is not taken,"" Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. ""So far the response has been weak, weak. Why?"" Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged the White House to take the lead on providing internet access to Cuba after the Havana regime shut down social media sites at the height of the protests. ""The Cuban people have lost their ability to communicate with one another, and many Floridians born in Cuba have no information on the safety of their loved ones,"" DeSantis wrote in a letter to the president Wednesday. ""Equally as important, the world has also lost the ability to see what is happening on the ground as the Cuban people rise in support of freedom."" At a news conference in Miami Thursday, the governor said every option to supply internet service should be explored, including using offshore and satellite technology and converting the US Embassy in Cuba to a kind of hotspot. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth. And if were able to help Cubans communicate with one another -- also communicate to the outside world -- that truth is going to matter. That truth, I think, will be decisive,"" DeSantis said. ""And so, Mr. President, nows the time to stand up and be counted."" At a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday afternoon, Biden said the administration was ""considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access."" But Democrats in Southern Florida are urging the president to take advantage of the protests in Cuba -- and boost his standing among Cuban-Americans, who supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. State Sen. Shevrin Jones said Joe Biden appearing with Cuban community leaders would help him dismiss criticism from Republicans. AP Photo/Steve Cannon ""I really believe this is one of those moments, I put it up with the moment of 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall because I do believe we can give the hope to the people in Cuba,"" Democratic state Sen. Annette Taddeo  said , referring to Reagans 1987 speech in front of the Berlin Wall. ""Its really about the people in Cuba who need to hear it. The words of the president of the U.S., be it Republican or Democrat, should matter ,"" said Taddeo, who  is considering challenging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 , according to the Miami Herald . The presidents presence in Southern Florida could be a game-changer, she said. Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, has helped lead the criticism against Bidens handling of the growing unrest. Stefani Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images Biden won the heavily Democratic Miami-Dade County by only 7 percentage points in 2020, but it fell far short of Hillary Clintons 29-point margin in 2016. ""Actions speak louder than words and again, to me, coming to Miami is an action in itself that is very strong,"" Taddeo said. ""Weve got a real crisis. We need to grab that opportunity, which is why I compare it to the moment of Mr. Gorbachev. "" State Sen. Shevrin Jones said Biden appearing with Cuban community leaders would help him dismiss criticism from Republicans, who, he said, often speak more forcefully about Cuba and Haiti. ""This is a prime opportunity for the president to engage with not only the Cuban leadership in South Florida but also the Haitian leadership in South Florida,"" said Jones,  the Miami Herald reported. ""Its clear theres a disconnect between Cuban-Americans and the Democrats,"" he said. Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo said, ""Actions speak louder than words.""

""Cuba is unfortunately a failed state and repressing their citizens. There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government,"" Biden said. ""For example, the ability to send remittances back to Cuba. We would not do that now because the fact is it's highly likely the regime would confiscate those remittances or big chunks of it.""

79,https://theconversation.com/cubas-mass-protests-are-driven-by-the-misery-of-covid-and-economic-sanctions-164505,"Cuba has recently riven by what the BBC has referred to as ""the biggest protests in decades"". What appear to be largely spontaneous outpourings of anger at the hardship faced by many people are being blamed on a severe downturn in the economy, which contracted by 11% last year and has continued to slump in 2021. The protests reflect popular frustration arising from worsening shortages, growing queues and recent power cuts. You can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa, here. Like other tourism-dependent economies, Cuba has suffered a severe shock as a result of the closure of borders due to COVID-19. In 2019 tourism accounted for 20% of all foreign exchange earnings, and the closure of borders in March 2020 resulted in a 75% fall in international arrivals for the year. But Cubas current economic difficulties do not arise only from the pandemic: they are also the result of US policy. Sanctions bite Thanks to US hostility, Cuba remains barred from access to emergency international financing from multilateral financial institutions (including the IMF, World Bank or Inter-American Development Bank) that are helping to cushion the blow for its Caribbean neighbours. The country is also suffering from a series of measures introduced during Donald Trumps administration to tighten US sanctions. Starting in 2017 and accelerating towards the end of his term, these had cut the number of international visitors and curtailed remittances flows. They also interrupted deliveries of oil imports, hampered (and added significant cost to) international trade and deterred foreign investment. Possibly the most damaging single measure, announced as a parting shot by Trump just ten days before he left office in January 2021, was the decision to return Cuba to the US State Departments list of ""state sponsors of terrorism"". At the time this received little attention. It was not heeded by US allies, such as Canada, the EU or the UK, which regard the US allegations as baseless, and continue their official engagement and fruitful collaboration with the Cuban government. But, for international businesses, including financial institutions, the inclusion of Cuba on the list set off warning lights in compliance departments, which bear responsibility for minimising the risk of falling foul of international sanctions. In line with the process of ""derisking"" that has intensified in recent years as the capacity of regulators to identify suspicious transactions has increased, most businesses have refused to engage in transactions involving Cuba. As a result, since January it has become increasingly difficult for any Cuban entities (including those sourcing medical supplies and food) to conduct trade, and almost impossible to arrange financing. COVID cripples In 2020, Cubas performance in terms of containing the spread of COVID-19 was exceptionally positive. But the economic contraction, disease-prevention measures and the diversion of government money towards this effort was already creating severe hardships, with lengthening queues for basic goods and rising prices. EPA-EFE/Ernesto Mastrascusa Then in January, Cuba experienced a second wave, with daily cases rising to an average of around 1,000 until June. And finally, they shot up alarmingly in July, to reach around 6,000. As of July 14, the cumulative death rate of 14.2 per 100,000 remains well below that of the US (now at at 182), but the daily number of deaths has reached 50. One of Cubas home-produced vaccines has proved over 90% effective in phase 3 trials and the vaccine rollout has begun to bring case numbers down in the capital, Havana, but the pace of production is held back by US sanctions and the spread of the virus at national level remains exponential. The combination of renewed COVID restrictions and diminishing resources have compounded peoples hardships. Also, the inflationary effect of a major currency reform, which aimed to eliminate the dual currency system, on January 1 2021, has added to a sense of insecurity. On top of all this have come power cuts caused by fuel shortages and technical problems. Hardship spreads The suffering has been particularly acute for those dependent on private sector activity. Between 2011 and 2017, around 1 million people - 15% of the working age population - had moved into the non-state sector, registered either as self-employed or as informal workers. State sector workers received substantial pay rises in 2020 and have continued to receive wages (albeit reduced) during the pandemic. But many of those working in the private sector, which had been mainly dependent on the spending of foreign visitors, saw their earnings dwindle as a result of tighter US sanctions and then disappear altogether because of the pandemic, leaving them with only minimal social security. The government has tried to protect the vulnerable and ensure that the basic needs of all Cubans are met, but its capacity to do so has been eroded. It has tried to control the prices of essential items, but growing shortages and rising prices in black markets have compounded the atmosphere of fear and desperation. At the same time, attempts by local authorities to respond to complaints about profiteers by suppressing black markets have brought conflicts. Resentments between Cubans have grown, and tempers are frayed. The protests in Cuba sprang from real economic suffering, and daily frustrations and resentments. Since July 11, the government has introduced new measures in an attempt to placate protesters and signalled a willingness to listen to complaints, although with its limited resources it can do little to ameliorate conditions in the short term. But the US government could do so, simply by reversing the Trump measures: a policy that was promised in the election campaign but has yet to be delivered.",['Emily Morris'],7/16/2021 0:00,Cuba's mass protests are driven by the misery of COVID and economic sanctions,"['sanctions', 'suffering', 'mass', 'driven', 'severe', 'rising', 'protests', 'covid', 'cuba', 'sector', 'result', 'measures', 'cubas', 'shortages', 'economic', 'misery', 'international']","Cuba has recently riven by what the BBC has referred to as ""the biggest protests in decades"".

82,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fake-news-muddies-online-waters-during-cuba-protests-2021-07-16/,"HAVANA, July 16 (Reuters) - False news reports spread fast following unprecedented protests in Cuba last Sunday, among them: Raul Castro had fled to ally Venezuela, protesters had kidnapped a provincial Communist Party chief, and Caracas was sending in troops. The Cuban government said they were spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics of the government said they may have come from the authorities themselves. Neither provided evidence for their claims and Reuters was unable to ascertain the origins of the stories. The Cuban government said the stories, which spread on social media and messaging apps, were part of a broader U.S.-backed attempt by counter-revolutionaries to destabilize the country. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""What calumnies, what lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel late on Wednesday, exposing some of the fake news stories on a televised roundtable. ""The way they are using social media is poisonous and alienating."" ""It is an expression of media terrorism,"" he said. Government critics said authorities could be planting the stories to muddy online waters with misinformation and sow confusion so that no-one trusts future news of unrest. ""Often it is state security launching these kind of rumors to afterwards... say they are foreign-directed campaigns to manipulate Cubans so people stop trusting in information circulating outside government control,"" wrote Mexican-based communications specialist Jose Raul Gallego on Facebook. Both the government and some of its most prominent critics urged Cubans to take care not to share non-verified information. Some of the stories were amplified by Cubans abroad cheering on the protests. The proliferation of manufactured or misleading videos and content on social media has become a common feature of social protests around the world in recent years, including in Chile, Bolivia, the United States and France. Thousands took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilized. Early reports of protests on Sunday were also followed swiftly by internet outages and restrictions on social media and messaging platforms. Service was slowly returning to normal by Friday. SOCIAL MEDIA - TOOL OR BURDEN? The introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago and the subsequent flourishing of social media and independent news outlets in Cuba has been a key factor behind the protests. These tools have given Cubans a platform to share and amplify their frustrations and enabled the word to get out quickly when people are on the street, analysts say. Many Cubans learned of Sunday's protests on messaging applications like WhatsApp or on Facebook. But Cuba's government, which has long had a monopoly on mass media, warned citizens against believing news and images shared on social media that may have been manipulated. Posts shared thousands of times in recent days were mislabeled as Cuban protests. Some included photos that showed a large crowd during Cuba's 2018 May Day march or a protest in Egypt in 2011. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez accused social media platforms of generally only launching investigations into suspected fake news when it hurt the ""powerful."" ""It's known which monopolies operate in the digital space... how they work, in which countries they are headquarters... and how much politics goes on,"" he told a news briefing on Tuesday. Twitter, which has not reported taking down any coordinated attempts to influence events around the Cuba protests with misinformation, said in a statement: ""Investigations are ongoing. We'll continue to monitor the situation and remain vigilant."" Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reinaldo Escobar, editor of independent news site 14ymedio, said that regardless of who published the fake news and with what motivation, many Cubans now had the direct experience of participating in or observing genuine spontaneous demonstrations. ""This massive coming out of the closet of fear will have consequences,"" he said.

83,https://havanatimes.org/features/the-internet-blackout-that-followed-protests-in-cuba/,"Photo: Ernesto Verdecia By Jorge Carlos de la Paz (El Toque) HAVANA TIMES - When the massive protests broke out on Sunday, July 11, the Government decided without warning to restrict access to social media and other internet services. Reports began to come in from Cubans about the missing services. Additionally, the restrictions were confirmed by a report from the internet monitor, NetBlocks. After more than 48 hours without internet, various Cubans on the island reported a gradual reestablishment of access to the network. Data from Internet NetBlocks confirmed the partial interruption of social media and messaging networks from July 12th. WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and some servers of Telegram were blocked by the Cuban Telecommunications Company (Etecsa). ""The NetBlocks internet performance metrics at 50 points of observation from July 12th, 2021 confirmed that the front end and back end servers of the listed online platforms have stopped being partially or totally available to landlines and cell phones in Cuba, which corroborates reports from users,"" the company reported. During this lapse, Cubans were unable to communicate using these networks both inside and outside the country. Likewise, online consumer services were blocked and, of course, access to groups buying and selling food, medicine, and other products in messaging and other social media platforms. Sunday, July 11, thousands of people came into the streets across the country in an unprecedented demonstration inside Cuba. They demanded freedom, change, vaccination, and, generally, solutions to the current crisis in the nation. The government reacted with a confrontational attitude arguing that the demonstrations were only ""acts of public disorder and vandalism"" encouraged from outside the country. After convoking ""the revolutionaries"" to take over the streets and confront the protestors,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel declared ""the people"" were reacting spontaneously. ""defending their reasons and their truths, and we have many comrades who have been injured, many of these people were beaten and stoned by all these delinquents."" There are reports and evidence of known groups of para-police dressed as civilians passing for ""the people"" acting under the passive gaze of the uniformed forces of order with whom they collaborate. The Cuban government pointed to external enemies as the only cause of what it called ""disturbances"" and blamed social media for having incited Sundays actions. Tuesday, July 13, the Minister of Foreign Relations, Bruno Rodriguez, was asked twice at a press conference by foreign journalists about the restriction of data in Cuba. ""In the face of attacks, of course we will respond with measures in an appropriate manner and always based on consensus,"" he said, alluding to difficulties in the network and computer nodes as being cause by ""the difficult economic situation."" Rodriguez mentioned that ""the nation is living through a complex situation,"" and he recognized that access to information is a right; however, the diplomat avoided confirming that the cut was deliberate, nor did he explain why it happened, directing his comments to problems in the distribution of food and electricity. Shortly thereafter, journalist Arleen Rodriguez admitted on the Roundtable program that ""the cut"" to service had been deliberate. ""I understand, as a journalist, although it hurts me, the cut in social media because its where the war against Cuba is being carried out,"" she said, referring to another topic. Cuban citizens have expressed anger over this restriction that has kept them without communication in the middle of uncertainty. Whats more, we are talking about one of the highest-priced services in the country (1gb for 100 CUP ($4 USD) is the most economical option). In response to a complaint from a Facebook user, the Matanzas provincial government justified the limitation of access to a ""saturation in the lines"" and promised that they would transmit the complaint to the Etecsa authorities.

84,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/16/fake-news-proliferating-online-during-cuba-protests,"The government says they are spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics say it is the authorities themselves. False news reports have spread fast following unprecedented protests in Cuba. Among them: former President Raul Castro had fled to ally Venezuela, protesters had kidnapped a provincial Communist Party chief and Caracas was sending in troops. The Cuban government said they were spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics of the government said they may have come from the authorities themselves. Neither provided evidence for their claims and the Reuters news agency was unable to ascertain the origins of the stories. The government said the stories, which spread on Sunday on social media and messaging apps, were part of a broader US-backed attempt by counter-revolutionaries to destabilise the country. ""What calumnies, what lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel late on Wednesday, exposing some of the fake news stories on a televised roundtable. ""The way they are using social media is poisonous and alienating."" ""It is an expression of media terrorism,"" he said. Government critics said authorities could be planting the stories to muddy online waters with misinformation and sow confusion so that no one trusts future news of unrest. ""Often it is state security launching these kind of rumors to afterwards ... say they are foreign-directed campaigns to manipulate Cubans so people stop trusting in information circulating outside government control,"" wrote Mexican-based communications specialist Jose Raul Gallego on Facebook. The government and some of its most prominent critics urged Cubans to be careful not to share non-verified information. Some of the stories were amplified by Cubans abroad cheering on the protests. The proliferation of manufactured or misleading videos and content on social media has become a common feature of social protests around the world in recent years, including in Chile, Bolivia, the United States and France. Thousands took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilised. Early reports of protests on Sunday were also followed swiftly by internet outages and restrictions on social media and messaging platforms. Service was slowly returning to normal by Friday. The introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago and the subsequent flourishing of social media and independent news outlets in Cuba has been a key factor behind the protests. These tools have given Cubans a platform to share and amplify their frustrations and enabled the word to get out quickly when people are on the street, analysts say. Many Cubans learned of Sundays protests on messaging applications such as WhatsApp or on Facebook. Musician Alexander Delgado, a member of the Cuban reggaeton band Gente de Zona, taking part in a rally in solidarity with protesters in Cuba, in Little Havana neighbourhood in Miami, Florida, US [Marco Bello/Reuters] But Cubas government, which has long had a monopoly on mass media, warned citizens against believing news and images shared on social media that may have been manipulated. Posts shared thousands of times in recent days were mislabeled as Cuban protests. Some included photos that showed a large crowd during Cubas 2018 May Day march or a protest in Egypt in 2011. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez accused social media platforms of generally only launching investigations into suspected fake news when it hurt the ""powerful"". ""Its known which monopolies operate in the digital space ... how they work, in which countries they are headquarters ... and how much politics goes on,"" he told a news briefing on Tuesday. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reinaldo Escobar, the editor of independent news site 14ymedio, said that regardless of who published the fake news and the motivation, many Cubans now had the direct experience of participating in or observing genuine spontaneous demonstrations.

Jim McGovern (D-MA) stated that when former President Barack Obama softened American policy towards Cuba, ""people were sending more remittances to their families. You saw people supporting small businesses that were growing in Cuba. You saw more political space, a strengthening of civil society."" But former President Donald Trump ""turned everything back, and as a result, we see increased suffering on the island."" McGovern said that the Cuban government should respect the right of the Cuban people to protest against the problems on the island, free protesters they have arrested, and restore Internet access. He added that the Biden administration should recognize, as the Obama administration did, ""that our policy toward Cuba, for the last many decades, has been a miserable failure. This economic embargo, these sanctions that we have put in place have hurt average Cubans. They havent hurt the hardliners in the Cuban government."" McGovern further stated, ""When we began to ease things under the Obama administration, we actually saw a very different thing happen. One is that people were sending more remittances to their families. You saw people supporting small businesses that were growing in Cuba. You saw more political space, a strengthening of civil society. All those things are good. All those things help pave the way for a better future for the Cuban people. I mean, Trump -- I mean, Biden, at a minimum, ought to reverse Trumps additional sanctions, one of which, by the way, makes it difficult for a Cuban-American son or daughter living in the United States to send remittances to their mother or father in Cuba to help them get through these difficult times. I mean, thats a rotten, cruel thing that Trump did. We ought to be able to reverse it right away. And when people say, the Cuban government will take advantage of that, certainly, we can figure out a delivery system that will get it to the people who need it. But if we want to help the Cuban people, enough of the Cold War rhetoric. I mean, lets get down to the business of formulating a new, more constructive policy, one that actually helps the Cuban people."" McGovern concluded that the Obama administration ""was on the right track. When Trump became president, he turned everything back, and as a result, we see increased suffering on the island.""

(AP Photo / Ismael Francisco) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban officials rallied tens of thousands of supporters in the streets on Saturday -- nearly a week after they were stunned by the most widespread protests in decades. President Miguel Diaz-Canel-- accompanied by 90-year-old former President Raul Castro -- appeared on the seafront Malecon boulevard that had seen some of the largest protests against shortages and the political system the previous weekend. He made an impassioned speech blaming unrest on the U.S. and its economic embargo, ""the blockade, aggression and terror,"" as a crowd waved Cuban flags and those of the July 26 Movement that Fidel Castro led during Cubas revolution. ""The enemy has returned to throw all it has at destroying the sacred unity and tranquility of the citizens,"" he said. ADVERTISEMENT He ended without the traditional cry of ""Homeland or Death!"" -- a slogan mocked last week by protesters shouting, ""Homeland and life!"" Havana has been returning to normal in recent days, even if mobile internet data service - which authorities cut on Sunday - remained limited. ""There is political and social erosion ... There is a lot of disgust, we must talk more, do more things and things that were done wrong should be rectified,"" said Abel Alba, a 50-year-old civil engineer, speaking Friday. ""The president has tried to smooth things over a bit"" but he waited ""too long"" to listen to the demands of the people in the streets. The protests began Sunday when thousands of Cubans marched along the Malecon and elsewhere to protest food and medicine shortages, power outages and some even calling for political change. Smaller protests continued MOnday and Tuesday. Diaz-Canel initially responded by pointing to U.S. economic sanctions, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a social media campaign by Cuban American groups. But he later acknowledged some responsibility by Cubas leaders. With this in mind, Cuban Cabinet ministers announced a mix of measures including permits for travelers to import food and medicine without limits and allowing people to use their ration books to obtain subsidized goods outside their hometowns. ""The Cuban government has just shown that it could have allowed the entry of food and medicine without quantity limits or tariffs all along but chose not to do so for more than a year of the pandemic,"" wrote Jose Jasan Nieves, director of the independent digital newspaper, El Toque. ""People twisted their arms."" ADVERTISEMENT Authorities reiterated their intentions to finish authorizing small and medium-sized companies as a source of employment as well as a program for state companies to pay more than the current salary scale. What officials also made clear is that they are not willing to make changes to the islands political model. Street vendor Marlen Rodriguez, 66, was not optimistic following the governments announcements. ""There are no medicines, there is nothing, there is no food."" According to Diaz-Canel, there were four sectors involved in the protests: radical supporters of the United States who waved that countrys flag during the protests and demanded intervention from Washington, criminals who took advantage of the situation to loot, people genuinely desperate due to the impact of the crisis on their daily lives and young people who feel disenfranchised. The marches turned violent with police clashing with protesters, patrol cars being destroyed, shops looted, windows broken, stones thrown and violent arrests and injuries. ""When people with weak minds let themselves be influenced, these things like what happened on Sunday occur,"" said Tal(ia Linares, a 19-year-old student who turned out for Saturdays rally. ""So we are here to show that that isnt Cuban youth."" One government opponent died in the protests and the exact number of people arrested is not known. Government opponents have said on social media that the number is more than 100. On Friday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, called for release of the protesters. The measures announced by the government ""are positive measures, but they are insufficient,"" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny Perez. ""Without affecting the ideology, there is a lot of space in which the state can take action,"" he said, mentioning permits for private entrepreneurs to import goods without going through the state monopoly, allowing foreign companies to install retail markets or raising the ceiling for agricultural prices in order to increase supply. But political analysts said the economic challenges are great. ""I think the government is just trying to signal to people that it understands their desperation and that its going to try to alleviate some of the misery that theyre experiencing. The problem is that the government just doesnt have much in the way of resources that it can devote to doing that,"" said William LeoGrande, an expert on Cuba at the American University in the United States. LeoGrande said the unrest in Cuba and the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise have put the Caribbean back on the agenda of U.S. President Joe Biden. ""There is no question that the demonstrations in Cuba and the assassination of Haitis president and the resulting unrest there have pushed the Caribbean to the top of President Bidens foreign policy agenda, even though they would have preferred that it stayed on the back burner for a much longer time,"" he said. ""What the administration will do on Cuba is still very much up in the air.""",['Andrea Rodríguez'],7/17/2021 4:00,Cuba government rallies backers following big protests,"['president', 'backers', 'malecon', 'cuban', 'thousands', 'protests', 'unrest', 'cuba', 'things', 'political', 'following', 'big', 'rallies', 'protesters']","""The enemy has returned to throw all it has at destroying the sacred unity and tranquility of the citizens,"" he said.

87,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/freedom-cuban-americans-say-shortages-dont-explain-protests-rcna1437,"MIAMI -- As Cubans took to the streets to protest in numbers not seen since before the 1959 Revolution, Cuban Americans are challenging the view that the demonstrations are just about economic frustration. While Cubans expressed anger over shortages in food and medicine, rising inflation and power outages -- amid the challenges of Covid-19 -- many of the chants throughout the island called for political change and included expressions such as ""libertad"" (liberty), ""We want change"" and ""Down with the dictatorship."" Many Cuban Americans say that should not be glossed over. ""For the first time in 62 years, they are risking their lives from one end of the island to the other to demand accountability from the regime,"" Carmen Pelaez, a Cuban American filmmaker and Democratic political consultant, said. ""Im anti-embargo. But its not about the embargo right now. Thats not what this fight is about."" In the U.S., Cuban Americans hold different positions on U.S.-Cuba relations, some falling along party lines. But while conservatives and Republicans are known for a more hard-line stance against Cuba, some progressives have been denouncing the Cuban governments tough stance against activists' calls for greater freedom of expression. Many Cuban Americans have grown up hearing calls for ""libertad"" for Cuba in the streets of Miami and other U.S. cities, but its seldom heard in Cuba. Some Cuban Americans said it was emotional to hear the word being shouted by so many on the island. ""Policy differences aside, Cuban Americans strongly agree and understand that these protests are not about the embargo or even food shortages. Its opposition to the regime,"" said Giancarlo Sopo, a conservative media strategist. ""It doesnt matter if youre a Republican or a Democrat. We all recognize what these protests are about,"" said Sopo, adding that the chants called for ""libertad."" Cuba has been run by a Communist government, with a strong grip on society, for over six decades. Though the government has received praise for its ability to offer primary care to its population, it also determines many aspects of peoples lives, including wages, food and internet prices, as well as their freedom of assembly, expression and the ability to choose a president that does not belong to the Communist Party of Cuba. After the protests, Cubas government announced it would temporarily lift restrictions on the amount of toiletries, food and medicine that Cuban citizens can bring back home when they take foreign trips, but for many protesters on the island its a small concession compared to their demands, and out of touch with their basic needs. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel took some blame for the protests recently, saying failings by the government played a role, though he still says the United States is primarily at fault. Before the protests began on Sunday, public displays of dissent had been increasing in recent months. In November, authorities broke up a hunger strike by members of the San Isidro Movement, an artists collective, sparking a rare protest with hundreds of artists and activists in front of the Culture Ministry. Those who protested formed another group, called 27N. The leader of the San Isidro Movement, Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, went on a hunger strike in May and was forcibly taken to the hospital on the seventh day, drawing international attention and condemnation. Following the protests, the government faced scrutiny over its shutdown of social media and messaging apps. The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, on Friday urged Cubas government to address protesters grievances and called for the prompt release of all those detained. ""I am very concerned at the alleged use of excessive force against demonstrators in Cuba and the arrest of a large number of people, including several journalists,"" Bachelet said in a statement. ""It is particularly worrying that these include individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are unknown."" The streets of the capital, Havana, have been calm in recent days but a heavy police presence remains. Since Sundays protests, 55 out of 383 people who were detained nationwide have been freed, according to Cubalex, a human rights group based in the U.S. The words ""Cuba Libre"" or ""free Cuba"" was painted in large block letters on the street in directly in front of the Cuban embassy in Washington D.C. on Friday. For Cuba's government, the challenge will be to manage the acute economic crisis and the pandemic, while addressing human rights concerns and growing calls for ""libertad"" in Cuba and abroad. Cuban American musician Pitbull said in a widely shared video on Twitter that he felt frustrated ""having a platform to speak to the world and not being able to help my own people, not being able to get them food, not being able to get them water, not being able to get them medicine. But most of all, not being able to help and really get them what they deserve, which is freedom.""

It arrived, to their surprise, last Sunday, when Cubans on the island rushed the streets to denounce a Communist government that has left them oppressed, sick and hungry. Finally, exiles thought, the Cuban people were taking matters into their own hands. The uprising, led by artists and other young activists on the island, inspired thousands of their relatives, friends and former countrymen to protest in solidarity in Miami, Tampa and other cities in Florida, where three generations of exiles and their progeny have dreamed of a free Cuba. Even as the protests in Cuba have appeared to quiet down following the arrests of many protesters, the gatherings in Florida, including large ones in Miami, continued throughout the week. The flash of unrest re-energized exiles hopes for an end to the Communist regime, a cause that had, to some extent, languished after so many years of dashed hopes.

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity. A march was held Saturday in Hialeah for human rights in Cuba. Thats what those involved called the amazing show of unity. Local 10's Hatzel Vela joined the hundreds in Hialeah marching along West 16th Avenue for more than ten blocks on Saturday morning. Along the march, the crowd sang songs that have become synonymous to the Cuban struggle. It marked the seventh consecutive day of protests since the unprecedented uprising in Havana last weekend. Almost a week later and the love of patria, of country, remains vibrant in all generations. ""In 1980 my grandfather came here on the Mariel boat lift in search for freedom,"" said protestor Yazmin Gonzalez. ""His bravery is what led me to be here today."" The crowd started to gather at the corner of West 16 Avenue and 49th Street. Ad Homeland and life has become the anthem here and on the island. Like many here in South Florida, 25-year-old Yvelisse Suarez, who lives in Kendall, is concerned about her relatives back in Holguin. As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity. ""Im here for my parents, for my grandparents, for every family member that I have left there,"" said protestor Yvelisse Suarez. ""They dont have food. They dont have medicine and they dont have anything."" Daniel Rodriguez told Local 10 News his spoke to his mother in Cienfuegos Saturday morning, and that she tells him repression is high and Cubans are fearful. ""If you even like a comment against the dictatorship, they can come to your house and drag you out to the jail,"" he said. In Havanas Malecon, thousands took part in a staged pro-government protest. Many were bused in, and for the first time since the widespread protests, former leader Raul Castro was seen. On Friday, the Cuban community marched through Little Havana, calling for freedom on the communist island. Ad The group of nearly 150 people marched more than two miles, from Cafe Versailles toward Domino Park. Eduardo Moya with Lifestyle Miami, along with other organizers, planned Fridays protest. The hope is that the gatherings seen all week long will prompt change in Cuba that will ultimately free its people. ""We want to show them that the fight is on this side as well too, its not just them over there,"" said Moya. ""And continue to support them in any way we can."" The protests will continue during the weekend, with several scheduled for Saturday; one is planned at the Freedom Tower in Downtown Miami at 5:30 p.m. in which people like Willy Chirino and Emilio Stefan, among others, are expected to be there and speak at a press conference, scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Another protest is happening by boat in Biscayne Bay Saturday at 5:30 p.m. as well.","['Annaliese Garcia', 'Hatzel Vela', 'Bridgette Matter']",7/17/2021 14:14,Protests continue across South Florida in show of solidarity for those suffering in Cuba,"['streets', 'south', 'parts', 'florida', 'taking', 'nation', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'continue', 'ongoing', 'suffering', 'solidarity']","As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity.

90,https://nypost.com/2021/07/17/cuba-resorting-to-citizen-spies-internet-limits-to-crush-dissent/,"After stemming historic protests across Cuba by shutting down digital communications this week, the islands beleaguered Communist government is now beefing up a more traditional way of stifling opposition -- citizen spies. The rapid-response brigades, which are made up of civilian snitches -- neighbors, co-workers and plainclothes cops loyal to the regime -- are out in force after protesters demanding food, medicine and freedom took to the streets beginning July 11, according to dissident bloggers on the island. Cuban journalist Yoani Sanchez reported an increase in the activity of the brigades, and ""a heavy police presence"" on the streets of many large cities across the country on her ""Ventana 14"" podcast Friday. ""The government lost the street and are using anything they can to stop the protests,"" said Ted Henken, a Baruch College sociology professor and expert on Cuba. Cuban dissident Yoani Sanchez reported a ""heavy police presence"" on the streets of many large Cuban cities. Bloomberg via Getty Images The brigades are vigilante organizations first deployed to spy on citizens in the 1990s, at the beginning of the so-called Special Period, when the Soviet Union withdrew its economic support ushering in rationing of food and medicine and leading to a major popular revolt in 1994. ""They never stopped functioning,"" said Andy Gomez, the retired dean of International Studies at the University of Miami. The brigades are often combined with undercover cops, under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, which oversees domestic security and intelligence gathering, he said. Information collected from the brigades are used to target government opponents, many of whom are arrested and tortured, often held for years without due process, Gomez said. A woman shouts during an anti-government protest in Havana, Cuba on July 11, 2021. Ismael Francisco/AP There are thousands of brigade members throughout the island, according to Gomez. Many are fiercely loyal to the regime, while others are forced to sign up to snitch if they want to keep their government jobs. The spies linked to MININT, as the Ministry of the Interior is known, are universally feared on the island, much more so than the Cuban military, which has never been deployed against Cubans, Gomez told The Post. ""Cuba has never called on the armed forces to put down any social unrest because they consider themselves an army of the Cuban people,"" Gomez said. Since the start of the protests, more than 200 people have been detained, according to human rights groups. Authorities have also raided the homes of dozens of demonstrators who they have identified from videos of the protests, Henken told The Post. People shout slogans against the government during a protest in Havana.

Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images ""I was arrested with the same contempt as Hitler treated Jews in Nazi Germany,"" said playwright Yunior Garcia Aguillera, a well-known opposition figure, who co-hosts the popular weekly podcast El Enjambre. Garcia, who wrote about his brief detention in a Facebook post Thursday, described how he shared a cell with several other protestors who ""were all Cubans, fighting for a free and prosperous Cuba ... a Cuba without dictators."" When protests first spread across Cuba this week, ETECSA, the state telecommunications company, shut down the Internet, accusing the US of funding a cyber-campaign to foment rebellion on the island. ""These days, the US doesnt need missiles or Marines,"" said Bruno Rodriguez, the Cuban foreign minister. ""They have bots and automated cyber accounts."" While the Castro dynasty that ran Cuba since the 1959 revolution officially ended when Fidel Castros 90-year-old brother Raul stepped down as leader of the Communist party in April, he is still very much in control, even though Miguel Diaz-Canel is president of the country. ""Its still Castroism without the Castros in charge,"" said Henken. Raul Castro made a rare public appearance alongside Diaz-Canel Saturday as Diaz-Canel blamed the uprising on the decades-long US embargo against the island. On Friday he slammed President Biden for calling Cuba ""a failed state."" ""A failed state is that which, to please a reactionary and blackmailing minority, is capable of doing damage to 11 million humans,"" Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. ""If President Joseph Biden was really worried about the humanitarian issues facing the Cuban people, he would eliminate the 243 measures imposed by President Trump, including the more than 50 cruelly imposed during the pandemic."" The advent of the mobile internet in Cuba, which came in December 2018, is the main reason behind the build-up of protests on the island, according to Henken, an editor of the recently published book, ""Cubas Digital Revolution: Citizen Innovation and State Policy. ""Everyone involved in any protest or march could suddenly document in real time using Twitter and Facebook Live, and no longer needed to be tied to a computer or hotspot,"" he said. ""Its a big blow to totalitarianism, which only thrives by keeping people ignorant and isolated.""","['Social Links For Isabel Vincent', 'Contact The Author']",7/17/2021 15:38,"Cuba resorting to citizen spies, plainclothes cops to crush dissent","['spies', 'streets', 'president', 'state', 'according', 'crush', 'cuban', 'dissent', 'cops', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'citizen', 'brigades', 'gomez', 'plainclothes', 'resorting']","After stemming historic protests across Cuba by shutting down digital communications this week, the islands beleaguered Communist government is now beefing up a more traditional way of stifling opposition -- citizen spies. Cuban dissident Yoani Sanchez reported a ""heavy police presence"" on the streets of many large Cuban cities. Ismael Francisco/APThere are thousands of brigade members throughout the island, according to Gomez. ""Cuba has never called on the armed forces to put down any social unrest because they consider themselves an army of the Cuban people,"" Gomez said.

91,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/17/cuba-president-denounces-unrest-as-a-lie-calls-protest-images,"Days after anti-government demonstrations, President Diaz-Canel says 'what the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie. Cubas President Miguel Diaz-Canel has denounced what he said was a false narrative over unrest on the Caribbean island, speaking alongside ex-president Raul Castro during a rally before thousands of supporters in Havana. ""What the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie,"" Diaz-Canel said on Saturday, denouncing the dissemination of ""false images"" on social networks where they ""encourage and glorify the outrage and destruction of property."" Diaz-Canels comments come six days after historic demonstrations against the government. On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities around the island shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""Were hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested, including independent journalists and opposition activists, since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. There is an ""overflowing hatred on social networks,"" the president said. Cesen la mentira, la infamia y el odio. #Cuba es profundamente alergica al odio. !Y jamas sera tierra de odio! No se construye nada bueno del odio. El odio nos roba tiempo para amar y hasta el amor mismo.

And it will never be a land of hatred! Nothing good is built out of hatred. Hate robs us of time to love and even love itself. TO #Cuba, #Putyourheart, Diaz-Canel tweeted. Protesters took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest against power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party political system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilised. Cuba cut off internet access on the island on Sunday and restored it on Wednesday, but access to social media and messaging apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter remained blocked on 3G and 4G networks. Diaz-Canel, who accuses the United States of having provoked the protests, said the ""lie"" was not committed ""by chance or mistake; all this is the cold calculation of an unconventional-war manual"". ""Born to conquer and not to be conquered!"" shouted the crowd at the rally, which had gathered at dawn on the Malecon, Havanas famed oceanfront boulevard. Castro, 90, was drawn out of retirement by the gravity of the protests. Shortly before the rally began, police arrested a man who shouted ""Patria y Vida"" (""Homeland and Life""), the title of a protest rap song that became the anthem of the anti-government demonstrators, according to AFP news agency. The official newspaper, Granma, said similar rallies were called in other cities including Santiago de Cuba, Bayamo, Camaguey and Santa Clara.",[],7/17/2021 15:55,Cuba president rejects coverage of unrest as a 'lie',"['hatred', 'president', 'lie', 'diazcanel', 'rally', 'odio', 'y', 'unrest', 'protests', 'cuba', 'island', 'coverage', 'social', 'rejects']","Days after anti-government demonstrations, President Diaz-Canel says 'what the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie.

93,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-government-holds-mass-rally-havana-after-protests-2021-07-17/,"HAVANA, July 17 (Reuters) - Raul Castro was among thousands who attended a government-organized rally in Havana on Saturday to denounce the U.S. trade embargo and reaffirm their support for Cuba's revolution, a week after unprecedented protests rocked the communist-run country. Government supporters gathered on the city's seafront boulevard before dawn to wave Cuban flags and photos of late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. The latter retired as Communist Party leader in April but promised to continue fighting for the revolution as a ""foot soldier"". The rally was a reaction to demonstrations that erupted nationwide last Sunday amid widespread shortages of basic goods, demands for political rights and the island nation's worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register The government admitted some shortcomings this week but mostly blamed the protests on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, told the crowd that Cuba's ""enemy has once again thrown itself into destroying citizen's sacred unity and tranquility."" He said it was no small matter to call a rally as the country saw increasing numbers of COVID cases: ""We convened you to denounce once more the blockade, the aggression and terror."" 1/5 People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Read More Authorities said similar rallies were held nationwide. ""This revolution will continue for a long time,"" said Margaritza Arteaga, a state social worker who attended the rally in Havana. Workers had been convened by neighborhood block committees, known as the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, she said, and a state bus had picked her up at 4 a.m. Shortly before the rally in Havana officially began, authorities removed a man shouting anti-government slogans including ""freedom"" from the crowd. The number of those detained during or after protests has grown as new reports trickle in amid irregular outages in internet and messaging applications on the island where the state has a monopoly on telecommunications. The latest tally from exiled rights group Cubalex put those detained at 450, although some have since been released. Activists have accused authorities of repression as some videos have emerged on social media of police beating protesters. The government has not yet given official figures for those detained although it has said it has arrested those it suspects of instigating unpatriotic unrest or of carrying out vandalism. State television has broadcast images of people looting Cuba's controversial dollar stores and overturning empty police cars.

94,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/two-asylum-policies-cubans-boat-southwest-border-odds,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The Biden administration this week warned Cubans attempting to enter the U.S. by boat that they would be turned back or sent to a third country -- all while tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the southern border are being let in. ""Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week about migrants from Cuba and Haiti coming across the Florida Straits. MAYORKAS SAYS MIGRANTS FLEEING CUBA, HAITI BY SEA WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER US As political protests against the authoritarian communist regime rock the country, there are fears of a spike in migrants fleeing. Mayorkas said DHS has not yet seen a surge, but warned that those coming over would not come in -- but could be referred to a third country. ""They are returned by vessels of interdiction. If individuals establish a well-founded fear of persecution or torture, they are referred to third countries for settlement,"" he said. ""They will not enter the United States."" While Mayorkas comments do not reflect a new policy by DHS, and such policies have been carried out by different administrations for years, it is a stark contrast to the Biden administrations approach to the southern border. There, the administration has ended the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) which kept migrants in Mexico and the Asylum Cooperative Agreements (ACAs), which were agreements with Northern Triangle countries to have migrants claim asylum there instead rather than in the U.S. Additionally, while it is expelling single adults via Title 42 public health protections, it is not expelling migrant families or unaccompanied children -- and has made it a focus to quicken the process by which families and children are processed and released into the United States, often without court dates. ARIZONA AG BRNOVICH URGES BIDEN TO REVERSE REPORTED TITLE 42 REPEAL AFTER BORDER NUMBERS RISE AGAIN His remarks drew criticism of double standards from the right, and accusations of cruelty from the left. ""Why doesn't he say this to illegals crossing our southern border?"" Texas Rep. Lance Gooden tweeted. NBC News meanwhile reported how human rights activists had described the decision as ""shameful"" and ""disappointing."" Among those criticisms was the contrast between what those encountered at the land border, and those encountered at sea. MIGRANT ARRESTS AT SOUTHERN BORDER ROSE YET AGAIN IN JUNE TO 188,000, TOPPING 1M THIS FISCAL YEAR Former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News that the approaches to each of the issues were inconsistent, and noted that Cuban nationals who entered via the southern border could be processed into the U.S. and would not be sent to a third country - which is completely different to what happens if they come by boat. ""So if you're Cuban and you make it to Mexico and you walk across the southern border illegally, they are not returning you to a third country,"" he said in an interview this week. ""But if you are Cuban and you try and flee by boat over the Florida Straits then they are according to the secretary, so its very inconsistent."" He argued that the policy the administration was pursuing with maritime interdictions, namely sending migrants to third countries, was similar to the Trump-era policy at the border which the Biden administration quickly unraveled. ""If they want to resettle folks claiming asylum in a third country, that's exactly what the Trump administration was doing for the southwest border, that's why we had the ACAs, its why we had MPP -- that's the whole strategy,"" he said. ""It should also be the policy, it doesn't matter how you come to the country, it should be the policy wherever were at, and that was the type of policy we were working on and getting to in the Trump administration so there would not be this rush and this crisis that you see today,"" he said. A DHS spokesperson told Fox News that there has not been a change in policy, and the policy has long been to return those interdicted at sea to their country of nationality or to a third country for resettlement. ""Individuals encountered on US soil are processed under laws governing such processing. Third country resettlement is an option for those who are interdicted at sea,"" the spokesperson said. There is also a question of the particular countries' human rights records. The communist regime in Cuba is known for its brutality against those who oppose it. Wolf said its record is one of the worst in the hemisphere, and so one may expect nationals from there to be a priority for asylum requests. ""This administration talks a lot about asylees and needing to protect individuals that are being persecuted, and I think of all the countries we see, at least in this hemisphere, except for maybe Venezuela, Cuba is probably the most oppressive government we have,"" he said. ""So the question is why are they not allowing folks from Cuba to resettle in the U.S. like they are folks from Guatemala when the asylum claim from Cuba is likely greater.""

On Friday, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced there had been more than 188,000 migrants encounters at the border, including more than 55,000 family units. Of those family units, only just over 8,000 had been turned away via Title 42, the stats show.",['Adam Shaw'],7/17/2021 20:32,Two asylum policies?

WASHINGTON D.C. - The fight for Cuban freedom continues to resonate across South Florida, while in Washington D.C. a so-called caravan for Cuba is taking its concerns straight to the White House. With signs held high and Cuban flags raised, crowds gathered Saturday to call for freedom for the island nation. Some South Floridians hit the road and made the 15-hour drive from Miami to tell the government to take action in Cuba. ""With this many people get together and chant someone has to listen,"" said Amanda Velazquez, a protester from Miami. ""We are trying to tell (President Joe) Biden we are here in your front door on our knees to help us to help our people. ""They are suffering through a system that completely failed them and oppressed them for 60 years."" Added Lillian Fonseca, a protester from Hialeah: ""If military wont be able to intervene because I understand thats not a possibility, at least if we can give them free WIFI."" Ad Florida Senator Marco Rubio took to the senate floor Friday to support the protesters. ""In 62 years of communist tyranny on the island we have never seen what is now up to 40 cities to which people took to the streets,"" Rubio said. Many of those gathered outside the north lawn still have family living in the communist regime and hope their efforts lead to change and the fall of the dictatorship.",['Ben Kennedy'],7/17/2021 22:15,Group from South Florida makes trip to Washington D.C. and protests for Cuba outside White House,"['dc', 'south', 'straight', 'makes', 'florida', 'white', 'taking', 'tell', 'cuban', 'trip', 'protests', 'group', 'outside', 'house', 'freedom', 'washington', 'took']","The fight for Cuban freedom continues to resonate across South Florida, while in Washington D.C. a so-called caravan for Cuba is taking its concerns straight to the White House.

Its time to do more -- by acting to secure internet access on the island. Since last Sunday, Cubans have been taking to the streets across the nation to demand freedom from the dictatorship, adequate access to food and medicine and the resignation of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The regime responded by telling police to open fire and by shutting down Web access to stop demonstrators from communicating via Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram and sharing images of his goons violence. In a letter to the White House, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla. -- and a Cuban American) outlined several steps Washington should take beyond well-wishing. The key: enabling open and free satellite Internet access. Biden said Thursday that hes considering it, telling reporters: ""Theyve cut off access to the Internet. Were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access."" That sounds like a stall: The feds should know that already, since the ideas been suggested for years, for example when Irans rulers shut down the Web to squelch protests -- and its an obvious tool to help freedom-lovers around the globe in such situations. People protest Cubas government in Miami on July 12, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Delay is deadly. ""Time is of the essence here,"" as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) notes: ""Every day that the regime has to black out the truth is a day they can get the upper hand on this."" But it looks like the White House is slow-walking any response -- or, rather, leaving it to drawn-out interagency discussions, as Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for the State Departments bureau of Western Hemisphere affairs, told Politico, even as she called the idea ""something that were very interested in promoting and advocating for."" Sen. Lindsey Graham said last week of Bidens slowness to even speak up in solidarity with the protesters that the prez is ""like a deer in the headlights when it comes to standing up to oppression."" That seems to extend to jumping on the internet idea. Desperate, hungry and oppressed Cubans are waving American flags as a sign of freedom in the streets of Havana: The least Uncle Sam can do is make sure their voices ring around the world.",[],7/18/2021 0:57,Biden needs to move fast to provide satellite internet for silenced Cuban protesters,"['silenced', 'streets', 'access', 'white', 'biden', 'web', 'cuban', 'internet', 'satellite', 'regime', 'fast', 'rfla', 'freedom', 'telling', 'needs', 'provide', 'protesters']","So far, all President Joe Biden has offered the tens of thousands of protesters risking their lives to call for freedom in Cuba are a few words of support.

97,https://www.trtworld.com/americas/cuban-president-denounces-unrest-as-a-lie-during-mass-rally-48466,"Fast News Thousands of people attended the government-organised rally in Havana to denounce the US trade embargo and reaffirm their support for Cuba's revolution, a week after unprecedented protests rocked the communist-run country. Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz Canel waves a Cuban national flag as he delivers a speech during a rally in Havana, Cuba on July 17, 2021. (Reuters) Cuba's President Miguel Diaz Canel has denounced what he said was a false narrative over unrest on the Caribbean island, as the Communist regime vigorously pushed back against suggestions of historically widespread discontent. ""What the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie,"" Diaz Canel said, speaking during a rally alongside ex-president Raul Castro and before thousands of supporters who had gathered on the Malecon, Havana's famed oceanfront boulevard. Government supporters gathered on the city's seafront boulevard before dawn to wave Cuban flags and photos of late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. The latter retired as Communist Party leader in April but promised to continue fighting for the revolution as a ""foot soldier"". The rally, and similar ones in other cities, constituted the regime's first public response to the anti-government protests that unexpectedly brought thousands to Cuban streets last weekend. Organizers described the event on Saturday as one of ""revolutionary reaffirmation."" READ MORE: Whats spurring anti-government protests in Cuba? 'Down with the Yankees!' Cries from the crowd - ""Down with the Yankees!"" and ""We were born to conquer, not be conquered!"" - echoed the anti-imperialist language of the original Cuban revolutionary, former president Fidel Castro. Diaz-Canel decried what he said was the dissemination of ""false images"" on social networks that ""glorify the outrage and destruction of property."" Those images, he said, had caused ""immeasurable damage to the national soul."" On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""We're hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. There is an ""overflowing hatred on social networks,"" the president insisted on Saturday. His supporters, summoned from work places and universities, waved red-blue-and-white Cuban flags and the banner of the 1959 revolution. They enthusiastically applauded both Diaz Canel and Raul Castro. The presence of the 90-year-old Castro, drawn out of retirement because of the gravity of the situation, was noteworthy. He wore his olive-green general's uniform, harkening back to his revolutionary role alongside brother Fidel. ""Everyone who feels something for the revolution, who felt something for Fidel, for all he did for this country and that we must continue to do, knows what Raul's presence here means,"" said one rally participant, 65-year-old Carlos Cruz. Diaz-Canel said the ""lie"" about widespread protests was not committed ""by chance or mistake; all this is the cold calculation of an unconventional-war manual."" READ MORE: One dead as crackdown against Cuban protesters continues Protests amid economic crisis After last weekend's protests, Cuba cut off internet access on the island for three days. Even after access was restored, social media and messaging apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter remained blocked on 3G and 4G networks. Social media is the only way Cubans can reach independent news outlets, while messaging apps are their main means of communicating among themselves. US President Joe Biden has said Washington is considering ways to ease internet restrictions, though analysts have warned it could be tricky for technological and political reasons. The rallies were the largest since the revolution and came as the country endures its worst economic crisis in 30 years, with chronic shortages of electricity, food and medicine amid a spike in coronavirus infections. The island of 11.2 million people recorded 6,062 new cases of Covid-19, and 52 deaths, in the preceding 24 hours, the authorities said. The toll stands at 275,608 cases and 1,843 deaths. ""With or without the pandemic, we have to defend (the revolution),"" said 73-year-old teacher Hector Roman, who wore a protective mask. Havana, under US sanctions since 1962, has blamed the show of discontent on Washington pursuing a ""policy of economic suffocation to provoke social unrest."" Biden called Cuba a ""failed state"" on Thursday and said its leaders were ""repressing their citizens."" He said the US was prepared to potentially send significant amounts of Covid vaccine to the island. Cuba has also been developing its own vaccines. Shortly before the rally began, police arrested a man who shouted ""Patria y Vida"" (""Homeland and Life""), the title o f a protest rap song which has become the anthem of anti-government demonstrators. The official newspaper Granma said similar rallies were called in cities including Santiago de Cuba, Bayamo, Camaguey and Santa Clara.

MIAMI - A large protest in downtown Miami happened outside the Freedom Tower Saturday afternoon and into the evening. Everyone in the crowd shared a connection to the communist country. Joel Gandara was just 4 years old when he came from Cuba on a boat. ""When the boat would go up, all I would see is the sky,"" he said. Rosa Iglesas, who left the island when she was 19, has a similar story. ""What my country needed is the same thing I came here looking for; freedom,"" she said. Iglesas daughter, is now pushing for freedom along with her. ""My parents came from Cuba, and they gave me a better life here, they gave me freedom,"" said Gabriella Quinitero. They were some of the thousands who came out to the Freedom Tower on Saturday, a landmark for Cubans seeking a better life. Thousands gathered outside Downtown Miami's Freedom Tower to protest for Cuba. (WPLG) The massive rally marked the seventh straight day of protests in South Florida, with many calling on President Joe Biden to take action. The unprecedented uprisings come as conditions in Cuba continue to deteriorate, problems only made worse by the recent pandemic.

99,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-battles-highest-covid-19-caseload-latin-america-rcna1453,"HAVANA -- Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, now has the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare protests that have roiled the Communist-run island. The Caribbean nation of 11 million people reported nearly 4,000 confirmed cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average and more than any other country in the Americas for its size. The outbreak, fueled by the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant first identified in India, has pushed hospitals at the virus epicenter in the province of Matanzas to the brink. State media has shown rare images of patients in beds in corridors and doctors complaining of a lack of oxygen, ventilators and medicines. Cubas handling of the pandemic was one of the issues that propelled thousands to take to the streets nationwide last Sunday in unprecedented anti-government demonstrations in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. Demonstrators also protested shortages of food and medicines and curbs on civil liberties. Cuba is not alone in struggling under new waves of the pandemic. But the political implications of such a crisis are greater in a country where healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of its ""revolutionary"" one-party system. Moreover the outbreak and subsequent lockdown and reduction in numbers of flights has taxed an already bankrupt economy where many work in tourism and others rely on travelers to bring in remittances and goods including medicine. ""The government has consistently made the case that one of the main accomplishments of the revolution is its world-class medical sector,"" said Cuban American historian Daniel Rodriguez, author of a book on medical politics in post-independence Havana. Rodriguez said the exacerbation of food and medicine shortages over the past year due to the pandemic-related economic crisis had already broken Cubas social pact. ""When the pandemic began spiraling out of control a couple of weeks ago, it appeared increasingly the revolutionary government was no longer able to protect Cuban lives, and the result was an extraordinary repudiation of the revolution itself."" ""Not even medicine"" Cubas government has blamed the demonstrations on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions tightened during the pandemic.

Picture taken June 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, July 19 (Reuters) - Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, now has the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare protests that have roiled the Communist-run island. The Caribbean nation of 11 million people reported nearly 4,000 confirmed cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average and more than any other country in the Americas for its size. The outbreak, fueled by the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant first identified in India, has pushed hospitals at the virus epicenter in the province of Matanzas to the brink. State media has shown rare images of patients in beds in corridors and doctors complaining of a lack of oxygen, ventilators and medicines. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Cuba's handling of the pandemic was one of the issues that propelled thousands to take to the streets nationwide last Sunday in unprecedented anti-government demonstrations in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. read more Demonstrators also protested shortages of food and medicines and curbs on civil liberties. Cuba is not alone in struggling under new waves of the pandemic. But the political implications of such a crisis are greater in a country where healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of its ""revolutionary"" one-party system. Moreover the outbreak and subsequent lockdown and reduction in numbers of flights has taxed an already bankrupt economy where many work in tourism and others rely on travelers to bring in remittances and goods including medicine. ""The government has consistently made the case that one of the main accomplishments of the revolution is its world-class medical sector,"" said Cuban American historian Daniel Rodriguez, author of a book on medical politics in post-independence Havana. Rodriguez said the exacerbation of food and medicine shortages over the past year due to the pandemic-related economic crisis had already broken Cuba's social pact. ""When the pandemic began spiraling out of control a couple of weeks ago, it appeared increasingly the revolutionary government was no longer able to protect Cuban lives, and the result was an extraordinary repudiation of the revolution itself."" 'NOT EVEN MEDICINE' Cuba's government has blamed the demonstrations on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions tightened during the pandemic. Several countries and non-government organizations including Oxfam called on Washington to lift sanctions this week. On Saturday, authorities organized pro-government rallies across the island attended by thousands.

101,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/emboldened-by-protests-cuban-opposition-websites-pique-government-2021-07-19/,"People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini July 19 (Reuters) - Years before becoming president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel pushed for greater public access to the internet at a time when it was only available to a tiny minority. He would eventually succeed in getting much of his country online. Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miami's Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cuba's expanded internet access. The Cuban government has accused independent media outlets largely based in the Miami area of provoking the unprecedented, spontaneous protests that spread across Cuba a week ago. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register One of the sites it singled out, ADN Cuba, slants its coverage against the government in Havana at every turn. It recently published a photograph of Diaz-Canel that was altered to look like a police mugshot. ""Genocide,"" it said underneath. Its coverage of the protests has concentrated heavily on the people hurt or detained. For days, the site led with a story that the nephew of a senior Communist Party leader called on his family and the government to ""lay down your weapons"" and ""listen to the people."" Another headline reported protesters in eastern Cuba shouted ""murderer"" at Deputy Prime Minister Ramiro Valdes. Aiming for a young audience, Miami Beach-based Diario de Cuba closely follows Cuban and Cuban-American musicians critical of the government. One recent front page featured separate headlines on the latest news and views from musicians Pitbull, Lenier Mesa and Maykel Osorbo, while also reporting that Silvio Rodriguez, a longtime ally of Cuba's government, was trying to ""rescue"" artists who have abandoned the government. Around a dozen such Cuba-focused news and magazines have their websites blocked in Cuba, but Cubans can access them anyway using virtual private network (VPN) services, and share them on social media sites generally available in Cuba. Some relentlessly berate the government while others, though still critical, strive for more fact-based journalism like the pioneering outlet 14yMedio. The independent site El Toque, which also has a number of Cuba-based staff, published an article debunking false anti-government reports and out-of-context photos circulating on the internet that grossly inflated the size of the demonstrations. While it is difficult to measure the impact of the U.S.-based sites on recent protests in Cuba, the government there certainly sees them as a menace. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez dedicated much of a news conference last week to criticizing ADN Cuba and two journalists by name while also condemning a social media hashtag campaign boosted by bots. He accused opposition media of working for the U.S. government, which funds a number of Cuban opposition media websites with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, according to U.S. records published by the Cuba Money Project. Protesters in Cuba have also spread messages of discontent and word of protests on social media platforms, mostly Facebook, and encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. Many of those sites were blocked following the protests, prompting U.S. President Joe Biden to say he would review whether Washington could help Cubans regain internet access. Even without U.S. help, Cubans find ways to see censored content with circumvention tools such as Psiphon. The company says up to 1.4 million Cubans were using its application to see banned content on some days last week, up from 18,000 per day before the protests. read more That would mean 20% of Cuba's estimated 7 million internet users used that one tool to get around censors. 'IMPOSSIBLE DELUSION' In 2013, when he was heir apparent to former president Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel said that continuing to ban the internet in Cuba was an ""almost impossible delusion that doesn't make sense."" Internet access gradually expanded after that and the landscape changed dramatically in December 2018 when Cubans were able to get internet service on their mobile phones for the first time. Readership of opposition media inside Cuba exploded, said Baruch College professor Ted Henken, editor of the recently published book ""Cuba's Digital Revolution."" Henken talks to the media outlets, which track their traffic through Google Analytics and other methods. ""Since December 2018 these outlets have gained a huge island audience and left the official media even more exposed as propagandists,"" Henken said. ""They (the Cuban leadership) miscalculated in that they didn't realize that this would very quickly, in two and a half years, blow up in their face."" Rodriguez last week accused ADN Cuba and others of carrying out a plan for which ""U.S. imperialism has worked for a long time."" The U.S. government does provide financial assistance to media outlets critical of the Cuban government. A company closely associated with ADN Cuba received $410,710 from the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote human rights in Cuba last year, journalist Tracey Eaton reported via the Cuba Money Project, which tracks the spending through public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. USAID said in a statement that it, the U.S. State Department and the National Endowment for Democracy have been funding programs ""to increase the flow of information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba"" since 1996. ""USAID has helped train hundreds of journalists over the last decade to inform Cubans on the island. Their work has also appeared in major international news outlets,"" the statement said. ADN Cuba's founder did not respond to requests for comment. The two journalists named by Rodriguez declined interviews. Another anti-government website, CubaNet, received $300,000 from USAID in 2020, its director acknowledged. Once a biweekly newsletter printed in Miami, CubaNet now has a team in Cuba in defiance of the authorities, and has published stories on the apparent wealth of the Castro family. Director Hugo Landa said ""we have never hidden"" the U.S. funding and that U.S. officials have never tried to influence coverage. ""If we ever felt any pressure from any of our funders to influence our content, I would renounce that support,"" Landa said.

102,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuban-opposition-websites-emboldened-protests-roil-government-rcna1451,"Years before becoming president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel pushed for greater public access to the internet at a time when it was only available to a tiny minority. He would eventually succeed in getting much of his country online. Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miamis Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cubaa expanded internet access. The Cuban government has accused independent media outlets largely based in the Miami area of provoking the unprecedented, spontaneous protests that spread across Cuba a week ago. One of the sites it singled out, ADN Cuba, slants its coverage against the government in Havana at every turn. It recently published a photograph of Diaz-Canel that was altered to look like a police mugshot. ""Genocide,"" it said underneath. Its coverage of the protests has concentrated heavily on the people hurt or detained. For days the site led with a story that the nephew of a senior Communist Party leader called on his family and the government to ""lay down your weapons"" and ""listen to the people."" Another headline reported protesters in eastern Cuba shouted ""murderer"" at Deputy Prime Minister Ramiro Valdes. Aiming for a young audience, Miami Beach-based Diario de Cuba closely follows Cuban and Cuban-American musicians critical of the government. One recent front page featured separate headlines on the latest news and views from musicians Pitbull, Lenier Mesa and Maykel Osorbo, while also reporting that Silvio Rodriguez, a longtime ally of Cubas government, was trying to ""rescue"" artists who have abandoned the government. Around a dozen such Cuba-focused news and magazines have their websites blocked in Cuba, but Cubans can access them anyway using virtual private network (VPN) services, and share them on social media sites generally available in Cuba. Some relentlessly berate the government while others, though still critical, strive for more fact-based journalism like the pioneering outlet 14yMedio. The independent site El Toque, which also has a number of Cuba-based staff, published an article debunking false anti-government reports and out-of-context photos circulating on the internet that grossly inflated the size of the demonstrations. While it is difficult to measure the impact of the U.S.-based sites on recent protests in Cuba, the government there certainly sees them as a menace. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez dedicated much of a news conference last week to criticizing ADN Cuba and two journalists by name while also condemning a social media hashtag campaign boosted by bots. He accused opposition media of working for the U.S. government, which funds a number of Cuban opposition media websites with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, according to U.S. records published by the Cuba Money Project. Protesters in Cuba have also spread messages of discontent and word of protests on social media platforms, mostly Facebook, and encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. Many of those sites were blocked following the protests, prompting U.S. President Joe Biden to say he would review whether Washington could help Cubans regain internet access. Even without U.S. help, Cubans find ways to see censored content with circumvention tools such as Psiphon. The company says up to 1.4 million Cubans were using its application to see banned content on some days last week, up from 18,000 per day before the protests. That would mean 20% of Cubas estimated 7 million internet users used that one tool to get around censors. ""Impossible delusion"" In 2013, when he was heir apparent to former President Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel said that continuing to ban the internet in Cuba was an ""almost impossible delusion that doesnt make sense."" Internet access gradually expanded after that and the landscape changed dramatically in December 2018 when Cubans were able to get internet service on their mobile phones for the first time. Readership of opposition media inside Cuba exploded, said Baruch College professor Ted Henken, editor of the recently published book ""Cubas Digital Revolution."" Henken talks to the media outlets, which track their traffic through Google Analytics and other methods. ""Since December 2018 these outlets have gained a huge island audience and left the official media even more exposed as propagandists,"" Henken said. ""They (the Cuban leadership) miscalculated in that they didnt realize that this would very quickly, in two and a half years, blow up in their face."" Rodriguez last week accused ADN Cuba and others of carrying out a plan for which ""U.S. imperialism has worked for a long time."" The U.S. government does provide financial assistance to media outlets critical of the Cuban government. A company closely associated with ADN Cuba received $410,710 from the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote human rights in Cuba last year, journalist Tracey Eaton reported via the Cuba Money Project, which tracks the spending through public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. Representatives for USAID did not respond to a request for comment over the weekend. ADN Cubas founder also did not respond to requests for comment. The two journalists named by Rodriguez declined interviews. Another anti-government website, CubaNet, received $300,000 from USAID in 2020, its director acknowledged. Once a biweekly newsletter printed in Miami, CubaNet now has a team in Cuba in defiance of the authorities, and has published stories on the apparent wealth of the Castro family. Director Hugo Landa said ""we have never hidden"" the U.S. funding and that U.S. officials have never tried to influence coverage. ""If we ever felt any pressure from any of our funders to influence our content, I would renounce that support,"" Landa said. With or without U.S. funding, the sites are trying to reach readers like Jorge Norris, a 35-year-old IT engineer in Cuba, who uses a VPN to read sites such as Diario de Cuba and 14yMedio along with official Cuban media. ""Its another view to be able to form an idea of whats happening in the world,"" Norris said. ""You have to be completely informed of what they say here in Cuba and in the world.""",[],7/19/2021 10:04,"Cuban opposition websites, emboldened by protests, roil government","['media', 'opposition', 'websites', 'roil', 'cuban', 'internet', 'protests', 'published', 'cuba', 'adn', 'cubans', 'week', 'emboldened', 'sites']","Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miamis Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cubaa expanded internet access.

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - As protests calling for change in Cuba continue to occur throughout South Florida, especially in Miami-Dade County, the Cuban government has made an unprecedented announcement to allow donations to the island. The communist nation announced all plane passengers will be allowed to bring unlimited supplies of food, medicine, and hygiene products to the country between now and the end of the year. ""I actually spent the entire year of COVID there because I got stuck. So, I saw how bad it was, and its just been getting worse and worse,"" explained Vanessa Grau who is flying to Cuba with food and supplies. Grau lives in Miami, but has family on the island, including her husband. As soon as she heard about the change, she started a donation drive to collect extra food and medicine, which she brought on her flight to Havana, Monday morning. ""I just hope that it gets to go through -- I hope that what theyre saying is not a lie,"" she explained. ""I think that theyre kind of doing this to make people think, 'Oh, were good. Not really the truth, but, at least its allowing us to help some people there."" Ad The change comes more than a week after the historic uprisings in Cuba that sparked a week of solidarity protests all across South Florida. The latest protest occurred on Sunday, where nearly 100 people held a silent march through the streets of Little Havana hoping to call attention the plight of the people there on the island who are still in need of basic supplies. ""What we want to do is bring attention to the fact that people are being beaten on the streets. There are people bleeding out --women, children, youth, and that shouldnt be happening anywhere,"" explained Gabriella Gutierrez of Students for a Free Cuba. ""Just let people know that were behind them, that were going to continue fighting for freedom,"" added Grau. ""Because at the end of the day, the medicines help, but what we want at the end is freedom for all.""",['Trent Kelly'],7/19/2021 16:52,"Cuba allows plane passengers to bring food, medicine, and supplies until 2022","['passengers', 'end', 'food', 'change', '2022', 'explained', 'week', 'cuba', 'plane', 'unlimited', 'supplies', 'allows', 'medicine', 'worse', 'bring']","The communist nation announced all plane passengers will be allowed to bring unlimited supplies of food, medicine, and hygiene products to the country between now and the end of the year.

104,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/19/eastern-cuba-streets-death-regional-military-chief/,"Division General Agustin Pena, the commander of the Eastern Army of Cuba, died mysteriously on Saturday following rumors of Chinese coronavirus infection, leaving the military vulnerable amid nationwide protests against the ruling communist regime. Pena was 57 years old and, in addition to holding a pivotal military post, was a member of the Communist Partys central committee. The Communist Party did not disclose a cause of death or offer any indication of what preceded his passing. ""Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Sunday mourned the recent death of Division General Agustin Pena, chief of the Eastern Army, and sent his condolences to his family, friends and combatants,"" the Cuban state outlet Prensa Latina revealed on Sunday. ""On his official Twitter account, the president wrote that the news is very painful and sad."" No information suggests that Penas demise was directly related to the week-long protests throughout Cuba, which affected most of the regions Pena was in charge of the military in. Holguin, one of eastern Cubas largest cities and a command area under Pena, experienced some of the largest peaceful protests in the ongoing wave, which began on Sunday, July 11. In response to the protests, Diaz-Canel, the face of the Castro regime, ordered both the nations armed forces and civilians to violently attack anyone suspected of supporting anti-communist protests, resulting in significant violence in cities like Holguin. Some outlets have speculated that Pena died after being diagnosed with Chinese coronavirus, which has swept the nation in light of Communist Party mismanagement and the dilapidated state of its socialist healthcare system. The independent outlet 14 y Medio, whose journalists are based in Cuba, stated that multiple unnamed sources had relayed the information that Pena was at least suspected of suffering from the disease. ""Although official media have not offered information regarding Penas cause of death, Radio Rebelde journalist Aroldo Garcia Fombellida in Holguin wrote on his Facebook profile: 'he was liberated today ... against the mortal pandemic of Covid-19,'"" 14 y Medio reported. Cuba has documented 281,887 cases of Chinese coronavirus and nearly 2,000 deaths since the pandemic began, a number most experts believe is significantly lower than the true toll due to Cubas poor testing abilities and its history of fabricating medical statistics. As a member of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Cubas communist regime has close ties to its ideological allies in Beijing and has actively courted Chinese tourism. The regime also invited tourists from coronavirus hotspots like Italy at the height of the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020 while refusing to close schools or implement social distancing measures for Cuban citizens. Cubanet, another independent outlet reliant on journalists on the island, reported that widespread protests continued in at least two eastern cities, Guantanamo and Baracoa, on Saturday. Authorities arrested two Cubanet journalists last weekend for attempting to cover the first wave of protests. The Castro regime shut off access to the internet for nearly all citizens in Cuba following July 11, severely limiting the information - and images - the international media are now privy to regarding the situation on the ground in the country. Cubanet reported that ""political police,"" special forces reserved for repressing dissidents, took over Baracoa after protests began, but that the heavy law enforcement presence has not limited public displays of support for an end to the regime. Videos of protests in Baracoa, dated Saturday, July 17, surfaced on social media this weekend, showing large crowds of peaceful protesters marching in the streets. The videos appear to be taken on mobile phones by anonymous sources however, and Breitbart News could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos: Much of Cuba appears to be in a state of de facto martial law following the start of the protests, multiple Cuban interest news outlets have reported. The Spain-based Diario de Cuba newspaper reported on Sunday that San Antonio de los Banos, the city where protests are believed to have first begun last week, is flooded with ""trucks full of soldiers and the central plaza in the town has been seized by dozens of police, soldiers, and State Security agents."" The city also lacks any access to the internet, locals have denounced, with no indication of when Cubas state-run telecommunications company ETECSA will restore access. The nationwide protests resulted in an unknown number of arrests and enforced disappearances nationwide, at one point last week estimated to be as high a 5,000 people. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH) has confirmed as of Saturday 560 arrests and/or disappearances, many of them people who witnesses can confirm were taken into police custody or into hospitals after police attacks but whose family has no knowledge of their whereabouts. Many of those documented as missing or arrested are prominent members of the dissident community who already have ties to foreign groups like the OCDH; experts believe many of the arrested or disappeared could be in remote areas of the country, with no civil society infrastructure to seek to account for their wellbeing.

President Biden is considering augmenting staffing levels at the U.S. embassy in Havana and forming a group to deliver remittances to the Cuban people, a senior administration official told FOX News on Monday. ""On July 11, the world watched as tens of thousands of Cuban citizens marched through Havana and cities across Cuba bravely asserting their fundamental and universal rights and demanding freedom and relief from the oppression of Cubas authoritarian regime,"" the senior administration official said. ""The Biden-Harris administration has and will continue to stand with the Cuban people."" The president is directing the government to actively pursue measures to support the Cuban people and hold the regime in power responsible, the official said. Republicans have repeatedly accused the Biden administration of doing too little to help the Cuban people confront the communist dictatorship. MARION SMITH: MARXIST BLACK LIVES MATTER - HERE'S WHY IT SUPPORTS CUBA'S COMMUNISTS OVER THE PROTESTERS In addition to asking the State Department to review staffing levels at the embassy as a means to facilitate diplomatic and civil engagement, the administration is looking into ways to engage the private sector to make the internet more widely available to the countrys residents. It is also looking at ways to increase humanitarian assistance to Cuba and will continue to designate Cuban officials responsible for violent repression and human rights violations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this month the Cuban people carried out the most widespread protests the country has seen in decades over food and medicine shortages, as well as power outages. The protests turned violent as participants clashed with the police. Over the weekend, President Miguel Diaz-Canel gathered supporters in the streets and delivered a speech where he partly blamed the U.S. embargo for the unrest. Fox News Patrick Ward contributed to this report.",['Brittany De Lea'],7/19/2021 20:14,Biden may send more staff to US embassy in Havana to support Cuban people: senior administration official,"['havana', 'staffing', 'rights', 'violent', 'embassy', 'send', 'responsible', 'staff', 'support', 'cuban', 'senior', 'biden', 'fox', 'ways', 'official', 'administration']","President Biden is considering augmenting staffing levels at the U.S. embassy in Havana and forming a group to deliver remittances to the Cuban people, a senior administration official told FOX News on Monday.

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - The United States is expected to soon announce initial steps as part of the Biden administrations review of Cuba policy and in response to Havana's crackdown on the biggest street protests in decades, State Department officials said on Monday. The senior officials comments further signaled that President Joe Biden was not ready to soften the U.S. approach after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era detente with Havana, and that the latest Cuban unrest would have a significant impact on any policy moves. The officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, also made clear that the Biden administration is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people while keeping pressure on the Communist-led government in Havana. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Biden said last week he was not prepared to loosen restrictions for now on remittances, or payments that Americans can make to their families on the island, because of concern that the Cuban government would seize a large part of the funds. But Washington is looking closely at crafting a possible work-around to restore the flow of remittances, which were shut down under Trump, in a way that does not put money in the hands of the Cuban government, one of the State Department officials said. The official declined to elaborate but suggested it would take time to develop such a mechanism, saying: ""I wouldn't anticipate a short-term loosening."" Thousands of Cubans staged spontaneous anti-government protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Scores of activists were detained. loading The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. 'A TOP PRIORITY' The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency in the Cuba policy review, which began shortly after Biden took office in January but until now had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad. ""There will definitely be policy implications as a result of the events over the course of the last week. ... I'd expect in fairly short order there will be a senior U.S. government communication as to initial steps,"" one official said while declining to provide specifics. Cuba, the official said, is now a ""top priority."" ""It's a historic moment in Cuba given that the protesters showed up to more than 58 locations throughout the island numbering tens of thousands, making demands of their government for change,"" the official said. Under consideration as part of the review - even before the protests occurred - is whether to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" a label Trump gave to Havana just days before leaving office. But the State Department official said there was no timeline for a decision on the issue. Also figuring into the over-arching Cuba policy review is Cubas continued support for Venezuelas Socialist president, Nicolas Maduro, whose government is also under sanction by the United States, the State Department official said. Maduro has retained power with the support not only of his military and Cuban allies but of Russia, China and Iran. Biden, a Democrat, had vowed during his presidential campaign to ease some of the sanctions on Cuba tightened by Trump, a Republican. But analysts say the protests have complicated Bidens political leeway to do so, especially after he made a poorer-than-expected showing with voters in south Floridas anti-communist Cuban-American community, which backed Trumps tough policies toward Havana and Caracas and helped him win the battleground state. Many analysts say Biden may have to tread carefully on Cuba policy ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.

He also ordered a review of the viability of increasing staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The White House is hopeful that a boost in staffing could help it better facilitate civil society engagement following one of the communist islands biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory. The actions were detailed by a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Biden administration hadnt yet publicly announced the effort. It comes a little more than a week after thousands of Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island to protest food shortages and high prices during the coronavirus crisis. Its a level of frustration not seen in Cuba in more than 60 years. ADVERTISEMENT Biden is also calling for the administration to work with Congress to identify options to make the internet more accessible on the island. The regime moved to quickly cut off internet access to stop images of the protests from being broadcast to the world. Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, have been urging Biden to make free satellite internet access available to dissidents to help them subvert the Cuban governments effort to stop activists from getting their messages on social media. The administration will also look to work with international organizations to increase humanitarian assistance, while the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control will explore sanctioning Cuban officials who committed human rights violations against peaceful protesters in Cuba, the official said. Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond and Juan Gonzalez, a senior National Security Council official, met on Monday with Cuban American leaders to hear their policy recommendations and concerns in the aftermath of the demonstrations, according to the White House. Biden, who has been under congressional pressure to take action, last week called Cuba a ""failed state"" that was ""repressing their citizens."" But Biden also suggested that taking effective action was complicated. ""There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government,"" Biden said. ""For example, the ability to send remittances back to Cuba. We would not do that now because the fact is its highly likely the regime would confiscate those remittances or big chunks of it."" A dramatic drawdown of embassy personnel from Cuba began in 2017, unrelated to the Trump administrations antipathy towards President Barack Obamas rapprochement with the island . Instead, the removal of staffers from the U.S. Embassy in Havana began in the spring and summer of that year in response to unexplained brain injuries suffered by American diplomats, spies and other government employees posted to the island. The Trump administration also moved to reverse many of the Obama administration's initiatives, reimposing restrictions that had barred direct commercial flights by U.S. carriers to multiple Cuban airports and port calls by U.S. registered cruise ships. As president Donald Trump also sharply curtailed remittances that Cuban Americans were allowed to send to relatives on the island, barred financial and commercial transactions with most Cuban companies affiliated with the government or military and, in his final days in office, redesignated Cuba a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" in part for its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Biden said as a presidential candidate that he would revert to Obama-era policies that loosened decades of embargo restrictions on Havana, and the political right in the U.S. has accused him of not being supportive enough of Cuban dissidents. Thus far, the Biden administration has said its reviewing its Cuba policy and has done little to move away from Trumps posture toward the communist regime. Some of the more liberal members of the Democratic Party, most notably Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have criticized the Cuban government but also called on Biden to lift the embargo and argued that the embargo policy is contributing to Cuban suffering.","['Aamer Madhani', 'Matthew Lee']",7/19/2021 23:24,AP source: Biden looks to increase staffing of Cuba embassy,"['havana', 'staffing', 'source', 'increase', 'president', 'policy', 'embassy', 'white', 'biden', 'communist', 'cuban', 'ap', 'cuba', 'administration', 'island', 'looks']","(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)Demonstrators shout their solidarity with the Cuban people against the communist government during a rally outside the White House in Washington, Saturday, July 17, 2021.

""At President Biden's direction, the United States is actively pursuing measures that will both support the Cuban people and hold the Cuban regime accountable,"" the official said. The ""Remittance Working Group"" will work to ""identify the most effective way to get remittances directly into the hands of the Cuban people,"" the official said. Biden had said last week he believed that under the current circumstances, remittances -- the practice of Americans transferring money to their Cuban relatives -- would end up in the hands of the regime. But since then he's faced pressure to show solidarity with protesters. Cuba's government controls the financial sector on the island and all communications. Getting around the government to send money or improve internet access is a challenge other US administrations have tried and failed to overcome.

109,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scalise-slams-biden-disgusting-message-cubans,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., blasted the Biden adminstration Tuesday for telling Cubans seeking freedom not to come to the United States, while allowing thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. through the southern border. ""Think about what a disgusting message that was by the Biden administration to tell people from Cuba not to come here when they've opened up the southern border,"" said GOP Whip Scalise, noting some people on the terrorist watch list have tried to cross into the United States by way of the Mexican border. MAYORKAS SAYS MIGRANTS FLEEING CUBA, HAITI BY SEA WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER US Scalise's comments to reporters at the Capitol Tuesday come after Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said last week that those fleeing Cuba or Haiti by sea would not be allowed into the U.S. - and would either be returned or, if they were found to have a fear of persecution, referred to a third country. ""The time is never right to attempt migration by sea,"" Mayorkas said at a press conference. ""To those who risk their lives doing so, this risk is not worth taking."" ""Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" he added. Both countries have been hit by political unrest. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated and the country, which was suffered instability and insecurity for years, has reached out to the U.S. for military assistance. And Cuba has been rocked by protests against the authoritarian communist regime over high prices, medical shortages and other economic conditions. TWO ASYLUM POLICIES? CUBANS ARRIVING BY BOAT TURNED BACK BUT THOSE CROSSING SOUTHWEST BORDER FACE BETTER ODDS Meanwhile, the southern border has been inundated with a flood of migrants seeking asylum in the United States, with many not being turned away, but rather processed and given immigration court dates and released into the interior of the United States. In June alone, there were nearly 190,000 migrant encounters at the southern border, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Friday -- yet another rise in what were already sky-high border numbers, and bringing the total number of encounters in fiscal year (FY) 2021 to more than 1 million. While most adults and some migrant family units are being turned away, many migrant families are not being expelled, and neither are unaccompanied children. Scalise said Biden ""needs to get his priorities straight"" and help the Cuban people trying to seek freedom.

110,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/with-increasing-defiance-cuban-churches-urge-government-listen-not-repress-2021-07-20/,"HAVANA, July 20 (Reuters) - Cuba's churches have defended those who participated in unprecedented protests and even set up a hotline to advise the families of detainees, a sign of increasing boldness from spiritual leaders on the Communist-run island. Protests erupted nationwide on July 11 against shortages of medicine and food, power outages, the COVID-19 surge and curbs on freedom. The government blamed counter-revolutionaries it said were exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions. Hundreds of protesters, activists and journalists have since been detained, according to human rights groups. Authorities say they are prosecuting those who instigated ""unpatriotic unrest"" and committed vandalism.

After decades of repression following the 1959 revolution, an expansion of religious freedoms in the 1990s has given religious groups greater autonomy than any other organization not affiliated with the Communist Party. But such candor is still rare in Cuba, where significant restrictions on dissent remain in place. ""Amid the difficulties, the protests of recent days and also the detentions, the repression, the Church wants to pray for all Cubans, for all Cuba,"" Dionisio Garcia, Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, the country's second largest city, said in a televised mass on Sunday. The Cuban people need changes to feel hope, he said at the Church of the Virgin of Charity of El Cobre, the patron saint of a country where an estimated 60% are baptized Catholics. Protestant denominations also backed the protesters' right to express themselves, with the Methodist Church stating in a post shared on social media on Saturday: ""The fact of disagreeing with the political system does not turn a person into an antisocial element or criminal."" All urged both protesters and authorities to avoid violence in favor of dialogue. The conference of Catholic bishops expressed concern the government's response would instead be ""immobility"" and even a ""hardening of positions."" The Catholic Church in particular has played an important role in Cuban society in recent years, negotiating the release of political prisoners and fomenting the 2014 detente with old Cold War foe the United States. But government critics have at times accused the Church of not doing enough to confront authorities over human rights, in favor of a fragile entente that allows them a seat at the table of power. That may be changing. In his weekly address to the faithful in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff, said he felt close to those families in Cuba suffering the most in these ""difficult moments"". ""I pray that the Lord might help the nation construct a society that is more and more just and fraternal through peace, dialogue and solidarity,"" he said. The Cuban Conference of Catholic Religious opened a helpline for those detained and their relatives on Sunday. ""This is focused on providing counsel for the presentation of habeas corpus, help in locating the detainees, and spiritual and psychological guidance for the relatives,"" it said. Meanwhile, Cuba's Grand Lodge of Freemasons - a secretive society that also has a broad reach - said in a statement it was ""concerned by the excessive use of force"" by authorities. Masonic leader Jose Ramon Vinas went a step further, writing a letter to President Miguel Diaz-Canel accusing the government of always justifying the country's problems through the U.S. trade embargo rather than recognizing its own responsibility. He wrote later on Facebook that had been summoned to a police station where three officials questioned him over the letter. In a show of the growing sense of defiance in Cuban society, he said he suggested they came to visit the masons instead where they could speak on an equal footing. ""As I left, there was a cluster of brothers waiting for me, defying the curfew about to start - Masonic pride... thank you, thank you!""

WASHINGTON D.C. - The island nation of Cuba is facing a shortage when it comes to administering the COVID-19 vaccine. On Tuesday, thanks to thousands of generous citizens, the United States is lending a hand. Six million syringes of the coronavirus vaccine are on their way to Cuba after half a million dollars was donated, five times the goal of $100,000 that organizers had hoped to reach. ""The donations pouring in from Hialeah, from Miami from Fort Lauderdale from the places where Cuban Americans lives,"" said organizer Medea Benjamin. The vaccines should make a big difference for those in Cuba amid the pandemic and with the new Delta Variant spreading. ""These syringes will allow Cubans to continue to inoculate and vaccinate its population,"" said Felix Sharpe-Caballero with the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign. The donation comes on the heels of days of protests for the people of Cuba and a call for President Biden to help. Ad Cuba is also not working with an international organization, or NGA, that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday could, without fear of corruption, distribute doses. ""We would be happy to (send Cuba doses of the vaccine), we would love to get vaccines into the hands of the Cuban people. Cuba has not joined Covax,"" she said. This information coming as the White House ordered a review of US-Cuba policies. A senior administration official said the US is actively pursuing measures that will both support the Cuban people and hold the communist regime accountable for violence, repression and human rights violations. Representatives from the Embassy of Cuba in Washington D.C. pushed back though, blaming the embargo. ""The main cause for these difficulties are caused by again the 243 measures imposed by the past administration,"" said Rodney Gonzalez with the Cuban Embassy.",['Ben Kennedy'],7/20/2021 20:45,Millions of COVID-19 doses heading to Cuba as Biden Administration examines US-Cuba policies,"['heading', 'vaccines', 'white', 'shortage', 'biden', 'cuban', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'policies', 'cuba', 'million', 'syringes', 'examines', 'comes', 'uscuba', 'administration', 'millions', 'covid19']","Cuba is facing a shortage when it comes to administering the COVID-19 vaccine.

113,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-contests-claim-us-embargo-destabilizing-cuba-blockade-government,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, turned back claims by Democrats who followed Black Lives Matter and blamed the decades-long U.S. embargo on Cuba for sparking the recent historic protests. Rubio spoke from the Senate floor Tuesday, where he contended that people who called the embargo cruel either ""don't know what they're talking about,"" or are ""liars."" ""There is only one blockage in Cuba and it is the blockage that the regime has imposed on its people,"" Rubio said. WASHINGTON DC REMOVES 'CUBA LIBRE STREET PAINTING FROM IN FRONT OF CUBAN EMBASSY Earlier this month, pro-democracy protesters took to the streets across the island nation to call for human rights and basic necessities. Black Lives Matter posted a statement last week that blamed the U.S. embargo for the country's instability and credited the Cuban government for historically granting ""Black revolutionaries"" asylum. SCALISE SLAMS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR SENDING 'DISGUSTING MESSAGE TO CUBANS Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., was silent on the issue until Thursday when she issued a statement expressing ""solidarity"" with the Cuban people. She also called for the end of the 60-year-old embargo which she claimed, in part, ""profoundly"" contributed to the suffering of Cubans. On Tuesday, Rubio also criticized the decision by the Biden administration to review remittances to Cuba to ensure that money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. He also called on President Biden to listen to the people in Cuba and not the ""pro-regime people in your administration.""

114,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-starts-handing-sentences-historic-protests-rcna1481,"HAVANA -- An anti-government hip hop song by some of Cubas most popular musicians in exile became the anthem of the unprecedented protests that rocked the Communist-run country last week. Now the visual artist who filmed the Cuban section of the videoclip for ""Patria y Vida"" ('Homeland and Life), Anyelo Troya, 25, has been sentenced to a year in prison, according to relatives. He was charged with instigating unrest, they said, after attending a demonstration in Havana. Rights activists say this is just the start of what they predict will be a wave of summary trials of hundreds of people detained during and after the unusual protests on July 11 and 12 that the government has blamed on U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. ""They took him to trial without defense or lawyer or anything,"" Troyas mother Raisa Gonzalez told Reuters after witnessing his sentencing in what she called a collective trial of around a dozen people. The Cuban Foreign Ministrys International Press Center, which fields all requests from foreign journalists for comment from state entities, did not immediately reply to request for comment on the cases mentioned in this article. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday they had started the trials of those detained on charges of instigating unrest, committing vandalism, propagating the coronavirus pandemic, or assault, charges that could carry prison sentences of up to 20 years. ""There are people who will receive the response that Cuban legislation allows for, and it will be energetic,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on state television last week. He promised there would be due legislative procedure. But Gonzalez said she was not informed of her sons trial in time and when she arrived at the court with her lawyer, he had already been convicted. The trial was denounced by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) for taking place without proper defense or due process. Troya had already been under heightened vigilance for his participation in the song, whose headline is a twist on the revolutionary slogan 'Patria o Muerte ('Homeland or Death), his mother said. Javier Larrondo, a representative of the human rights organization Cuban Prisoners Defenders, said authorities would likely lock up the most charismatic and effective opposition leaders, who lately have often been young artists, whether or not they were at the protests. ""We will have hundreds of political prisoners in just two weeks,"" he said. The protests against Cubas worst economic crisis in decades and curbs on civil liberties first erupted ten days ago in a small town before spreading throughout the country. By the evening of day two, they appeared to have dissipated amid heavy security operations and internet disruptions. The government blamed mercenaries exploiting frustrations with hardships caused by U.S. sanctions. Exiled rights group Cubalex, which has established a spreadsheet of those detained that it updates every day as new reports come in, says more than 500 Cubans appear to have been detained during the protests or afterwards. It said the tally was likely higher, but some families may fear reporting the arrest of relatives in case of reprisals such as losing their state sector jobs. Some of those detained, like theater director Yunior Garcia, have been released to house arrest. ""I have four officials in front of my door preventing me going out,"" Garcia told Reuters, which observed the officials. ""When I go to buy food or cigarettes, one of them goes with me to keep a close eye on me."" The majority of those detained have been kept incommunicado, while the location of some is still unknown, said Cubalex and HRW, based on interviews with relatives. Cubans have been posting photos of people they say they cannot locate or sharing stories of detentions on a Facebook group called 'Disappeared #SOSCuba with more than 10,000 members. ""We went from police station to police station looking for her,"" said Alberto Betancourt of his sister, a stay-at-home mother-of-two who was detained at a protest in Havana. He located her after six days. ""They wont let me speak to her,"" he told Reuters, holding back tears. ""But shes not a criminal. She just let herself be swept up in the crowds."" Cuban interior ministry officials denied on Tuesday that anyone was missing and said a list of detainees circulating -- they did not specify which -- was manipulated and included people who were never detained. The detained include high profile dissidents like Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who also featured in ""Patria y Vida,"" and Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the countrys largest opposition group. They also include ordinary citizens and bystanders, families and rights groups say. Many of those detained had been beaten or mistreated by security forces or rapid-reaction brigades -- government-organized bands of civilian recruits, said HRW senior researcher Juan Pappier. Used to quiet streets, Cubans have been shocked over the last week by images of violence that have emerged on social media: security forces and bands of stick-wielding people in civilian garb beating protesters, as well as protesters throwing stones at police and overturning police cars. Diaz-Canel said last week ""maybe there will be a need for apologies to anyone who, in the middle of all the confusion, has been mistreated,"" and defended security forces actions to re-establish ""peace.""

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - Katiuska Mustelier Sosa says her brother joined the protests in Cuba on July 11 and shares video of when he was last seen. Because she hasnt seen or heard from him, she fears he was seriously beaten. Enrique Mustelier Sosa, 38, a self-proclaimed member of the opposition, was detained that day in the city of Guantanamo. His sister says she gained the courage to come speak to Local 10 News on Wednesday not just because of her brother, but because of the hundreds of other Cubans who remain detained or missing after those massive protests. She is asking the international community to speak out on behalf of the Cuban people. South Florida Republicans also came together Wednesday, asking President Joe Biden to take action. ""The time to act is now,"" Miami-Dade Commissioner Rene Garcia said. Said Tom Powers, Broward GOP chairman: ""Dictatorships are great for politicians. Theyre not good for citizens. You need to step up."" Ad The group is highly critical of inaction by the White House, which they argue has only met with mostly members of the pro-engagement movement. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, says she is encouraged by what the president has done so far. But she also wants the White House to continue the conversation with exiles. ""That the president hear from a diverse set of voices,"" she said. Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Scott joined House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and several other lawmakers to send a letter to the leaders of the member nations of the Organization of American States and the European Union, as well as to other democratic nations and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging them to ""stand up and support the Cuban people in their fight for freedom.""

(AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) Special forces police patrol the streets as they drive past a large Cuban flag hanging from the facade of a building, in Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, July 21, 2021. (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba criticized the United States and President Joe Biden on Wednesday for a series of statements by senior officials after the unprecedented protests on the island last week, accusing the U.S. government of seeking to justify a military intervention. Johana Tablada, deputy director for U.S. affairs at Cubas Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said U.S. officials are painting a false picture of the situation in Cuba, which is struggling with severe economic problems amid a surge in coronavirus infections. ""There is a Walt Disney narrative of a bad government and people fighting for their freedom -- stereotypes that scare anyone who has never set foot in Cuba, because of their arrogance and disregard for the truth,"" Tablada said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""They are very interested in fabricating an alternative reality because the riots of July 11 werent enough to justify the war that is being waged on us,"" she added. ADVERTISEMENT Communicating via social networks, thousands of Cubans took to the streets July 11 in various parts of the country to voice complaints over power cuts, long lines at stores, shortages of goods and rising prices, while some called for changes in the government. The protests ended in acts of vandalism, destruction of patrol cars, stone throwing at hospitals and looting. There were also violent arrests of protesters by the police, witnessed by AP, and according to authorities one death. Officials have not released a list of prisoners, but Human Rights Watch said in a reported Wednesday that about 500 had been arrested. The day before, Col. Victor Alvarez at the Ministry of the Interior said that some detainees had been released when there wasnt enough evidence to prove they participated in protests, but others were being processed by the judicial system. He did not give any numbers or other details. The protests were the largest in more than two decades, while groups of government supporters also took to the streets, including tens of thousands on Saturday. Authorities suspended cellphone internet data service on the island, charging that a campaign orchestrated from the United States used robot messaging on Twitter and other social media to instigate the demonstrations. Officials also insisted that U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration are responsible for the islands shortages of food, medicine and fuel. A petition on the Change.org platform created by a citizen in Belgium asking for the U.S. government to invade Cuba has been signed by almost 500,000 people, and some Florida politicians have raised such an action as a possibility. Tablada said that while there are no current U.S. military movements aimed at Cuba, there are signs of extreme aggressiveness, such as those that led to an interventions in Libya and Iraq. ADVERTISEMENT ""We are at a time when discourse has deteriorated to unprecedented levels,"" she said. ""From the Biden government in regards to Cuba, we have seen parading several times a day, every day since July 11, senior United States officials saying things that are not true"" about Cuba. Biden promised during his election campaign that he would resume President Barack Obamas policy of rapprochement with the island, but after entering the White House, he kept in place all the toughened sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump, including adding Cubas government to a list of sponsors of terrorism. The White House has said a working group has been told to review the U.S. policy blocking Cuban Americans from sending money to Cuba but to ensure that the Cuban government does not serve as intermediary in the flow of cash. Washington says it is also considering increasing the staff at its embassy in Havana to facilitate the participation of civil society. Cuba is going through one of the worst economic crises in its history, a mixture of its own inefficiencies, the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact from U.S. sanctions.",['Andrea Rodriguez'],7/22/2021 0:46,Cuba: US protest narrative paving way for military incursion,"['narrative', 'streets', 'states', 'sanctions', 'president', 'protest', 'military', 'cuban', 'ap', 'protests', 'way', 'incursion', 'cuba', 'officials', 'paving', 'united']","Special forces police patrol the streets as they drive past a large Cuban flag hanging from the facade of a building, in Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, July 21, 2021.

117,https://www.breitbart.com/news/us-sanctions-cuba-for-repressing-protests-biden-warns-more-to-come/,"The United States imposed sanctions on Cubas defense minister and a special forces unit Thursday for repressing peaceful protests, a step President Joe Biden warned is ""just the beginning"" of punitive measures against Havana. The US Treasury Department said its Office of Foreign Assets Control froze the assets of minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Special National Brigade (SNB), a division of Cubas interior ministry, in relation to human rights abuses committed during a crackdown on protests on the island earlier in July. ""This is just the beginning -- the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said in a statement. The sanctions were imposed under the Magnitsky act, which allows a US president to take action against human rights abuses and corruption. Biden said his administration targeted Lopez Miera and the SNB -- a special forces unit nicknamed the Black Berets -- because they were ""driving the crackdown"" against protesters who took to the streets by the thousands in rare public demonstrations against the communist government. ""As we hold the Cuban regime accountable, our support for the Cuban people is unwavering,"" Biden said. The president also condemned what he called ""the mass detentions and sham trials"" used to imprison and silence outspoken Cubans. Cuba pushed back swiftly, calling the sanctions ""slanderous"" and saying the United States should focus more on repression and police brutality on its own soil. ""I reject unfounded and slanderous sanctions by the US government"" against the Cubans targeted, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter. The sanctions freeze all Lopez Miera and SNB assets and interests in the United States, as well as prohibit any US citizen, resident or entity from engaging with them financially. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Biden, for his part, said Washington was considering multiple new steps. The United States is working closely with regional partners like the Organization of American States ""to pressure the regime to immediately release wrongfully detained political prisoners, restore internet access and allow the Cuban people to enjoy their fundamental rights,"" he said. Washington is also reassessing its policy guiding remittances to Cuba, with the State Department expressing concern that such funds could ""find their way into Cuban government coffers,"" according to spokesman Ned Price. Washington will ""continue to review what more we can do"" to support the Cuban people while holding the nations authorities to account, Price said. 'Weak response On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""Were hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. According to the Treasury Department, Cubas defense ministry and security services attacked people and ""arrested or disappeared over 100 protesters in an attempt to suppress these protests."" The demonstrations have further strained an already tense relationship between Washington and Havana. Cuba has seen a whiplash in US policy in recent years, with former president Barack Obama normalizing relations at the end of his term, declaring that a half-century of efforts to topple the regime had failed, and then his successor Donald Trump reimposing sweeping economic pressure. Biden as president had exhibited a go-slow approach to Cuba, but the unrest has thrust the relationship into a spotlight. Several US lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, applauded the administrations sanctions. For some Republicans it was not enough. Senator Roger Wicker tweeted on Thursday he was ""disappointed in the weak response from (Biden) and @StateDept as the Cuban people cry out for help.""",[],7/22/2021 13:52,"US sanctions Cuba for repressing protests, Biden warns more to come","['sanctions', 'states', 'president', 'warns', 'treasury', 'special', 'come', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'regime', 'protests', 'cuba', 'repressing', 'united']","The United States imposed sanctions on Cubas defense minister and a special forces unit Thursday for repressing peaceful protests, a step President Joe Biden warned is ""just the beginning"" of punitive measures against Havana.

119,https://nypost.com/2021/07/22/biden-to-sanction-cuba-officials-over-protest-crackdown-report/,"President Biden has authorized US sanctions against one Cuban official and a Cuban government agency in the wake of a crackdown on antigovernment protests. The sanctions target Cuban Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Interior Ministrys special forces brigade, nicknamed the ""Black Berets."" Biden said in a statement that ""my Administration is imposing new sanctions targeting elements of the Cuban regime responsible for this crackdown -- the head of the Cuban military and the division of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior driving the crackdown -- to hold them accountable for their actions."" ""This is just the beginning - the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said. But the sanctions against the Black Berets arent new, the Treasury Department noted in a press release. Former President Donald Trump imposed sanctions against the entire Cuban Interior Ministry, including the brigade, in January, and it does not appear that those sanctions were lifted by Biden. It was not immediately clear why Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who called the protesters ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"" and oversaw the crackdown, is not facing sanctions.

We will be battling in the streets,"" the Cuban leader reportedly said while urging pro-communist Cubans to counter-protest White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at her daily press briefing Thursday that ""we of course condemn mass detentions, sham trials and disappearances that are attempts to threaten the Cuban people into silence."" Critics have called on Biden to act amid the crackdown this month on protesters, who condemned communist leaders while protesting food shortages and a lack of COVID-19 vaccines. Although US sanctions can be a major inconvenience by freezing the use of bank accounts, credit cards and other financial services, Cuba is largely detached from the international financial system -- with salaries averaging $44 per month -- and its unclear what practical effect the new sanctions will have on Lopez Miera and the Black Berets. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel (second from left) promised he would ""battle in the streets"" to stop protesters.

The lack of internet access prevents distribution of information on protests. Former President Donald Trump was able to boost support for Republicans among Latinos last year by claiming that Democratic policies could turn the US into a larger version of Cuba or Venezuela. Biden last week denounced communism -- and said socialism wasnt much better, despite an increasing number of Democrats who self-identify as socialists -- when he was asked by a reporter to respond to the Cuba protests. But Republicans called on him to do more to support the activists in Cuba. ""As it stands now, hes basically just sitting there doing nothing,"" Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) said this week. ""Hes leaving these folks out to dry, and whats gonna end up happening, if they dont get any type of assistance, is the regime will continue to clamp down, and theyll eventually stamp this out and then theyll remain even stronger in power, and that will be a huge blow to the cause of freedom.""",['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],7/22/2021 17:38,Biden sanctions Cuban official over protest crackdown,"['sanctions', 'president', 'interior', 'getty', 'protest', 'biden', 'week', 'cuban', 'press', 'official', 'crackdown', 'miguel', 'protesters']","President Biden has authorized US sanctions against one Cuban official and a Cuban government agency in the wake of a crackdown on antigovernment protests. Former President Donald Trump imposed sanctions against the entire Cuban Interior Ministry, including the brigade, in January, and it does not appear that those sanctions were lifted by Biden. It was not immediately clear why Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who called the protesters ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"" and oversaw the crackdown, is not facing sanctions.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) FILE - In this May 7, 2021, file photo Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration announced new sanctions Thursday against a Cuban official and a government special brigade that it says was involved in human rights abuses during a government crackdown on protests on the island earlier this month. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control listed Alvaro Lopez Miera, a Cuban military and political leader, and the Brigada Especial Nacional del Ministerio del Interior, or Interior Ministry Special Brigade, as among those who will face the latest sanctions. Treasury said in a statement that Lopez Miera ""has played an integral role in the repression of ongoing protests in Cuba."" Cubas Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, which is led to by Lopez Miera, and other Cuban governments security services have attacked protesters and arrested or disappeared over 100 protesters in an attempt to suppress these protests, according to Treasury. The regime led by Miguel Diaz-Canel moved quickly, and violently, to stem the protests. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the actions by Cuban authorities, and violent mobs it mobilized, ""lay bare the regimes fear of its own people and unwillingness to meet their basic needs and aspirations."" ADVERTISEMENT The Interior Ministry Special Brigade was already sanctioned in January by the Trump administration, which targeted the entire ministry and Interior Minister Lazaro Alberto Alvarez Casas under the Global Magnitsky Act. ""I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. ""The Cuban people have the same right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as all people."" The move comes after the White House earlier this week announced that Biden had ordered his administration to take several steps to raise pressure on the communist regime after thousands of Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island earlier this month to protest food shortages and high prices during the coronavirus crisis. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez immediately took to Twitter to call the sanctions ""baseless and slanderous"" and suggested that Biden apply the sanctions on himself ""for acts of everyday repression and police brutality"" in the U.S. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control had been tasked with exploring sanctioning Cuban officials who committed human rights violations against peaceful protesters in Cuba. ""The Cuban people are protesting for the fundamental and universal rights they deserve from their government,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime."" Biden has also called for the State Department to launch a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. Biden also ordered a review of the viability of increasing staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The White House is hopeful that a boost in staffing could help it better facilitate civil society engagement following one of Cubas biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory. ""Weve made clear over the last week that addressing this moment was a priority for the administration and for President Biden,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. --- Associated Press writer Andrea Rodriguez in Havana.","['Aamer Madhani', 'Matthew Lee']",7/22/2021 17:43,US imposes new Cuba sanctions over human rights abuses,"['sanctions', 'rights', 'imposes', 'treasury', 'white', 'abuses', 'biden', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'human', 'secretary', 'press', 'ministry']","FILE - In this May 7, 2021, file photo Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington.

122,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/us-imposes-new-cuba-sanctions-over-human-rights-abuses-n1274765,"WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration announced new sanctions Thursday against a Cuban official and a government entity that it says was involved in human rights abuses during a government crackdown on protests on the island earlier this month. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control listed Alvaro Lopez Miera, a Cuban military and political leader, and the Brigada Especial Nacional del Ministerio del Interior, or Interior Ministry Special Brigade, as among those who will face the latest sanctions. In a statement, President Joe Biden said the sanctions were ""just the beginning"" of measures to hold those responsible for the crackdown accountable. ""I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence,"" Biden said. The U.S. would work with regional allies to continue to support the Cuban people, the president added. That includes working with civil society groups and the private sector to provide internet access that circumvents government censors and reviewing U.S. policy on remittances, which were curtailed under the Trump administration. The U.S. is also committed to restaffing the embassy in Havana to provide consular services to Cubans, Biden said. The Interior Ministry Special Brigade was already sanctioned in January by the Trump administration, which targeted the entire ministry and Interior Minister Lazaro Alberto Alvarez Casas under the Global Magnitsky Act. ""Weve made clear over the last week that addressing this moment was a priority for the administration and for President Biden,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The move comes after the White House announced earlier this week that Biden had ordered his administration to take several steps to raise pressure on the communist regime after thousands of Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island earlier this month to protest food shortages and high prices during the coronavirus crisis. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control had been tasked with exploring sanctioning Cuban officials who committed human rights violations against peaceful protesters in Cuba. Other steps included the State Department creating a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. Biden also ordered a review of the viability of increasing staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The White House is hopeful that a boost in staffing could help it better facilitate civil society engagement following one of Cubas biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory.",['The Associated Press'],7/22/2021 18:36,U.S. imposes new Cuba sanctions over human rights abuses,"['sanctions', 'havana', 'rights', 'imposes', 'interior', 'saidthe', 'president', 'white', 'abuses', 'biden', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'house', 'human', 'ministry', 'administration']","WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration announced new sanctions Thursday against a Cuban official and a government entity that it says was involved in human rights abuses during a government crackdown on protests on the island earlier this month.

MIAMI, Fla. - One day after the White House imposed sanctions on the Cuban government, people marched on Calle Ocho Friday. Yet another show of solidarity with the people of the island following weeks of historic protests. Following the newly announced sanctions on Cuba, we talked to political analyst Sasha Tirador, who participated in a White House call before sanctions were announced Thursday. ""We are not doing things off the cuff. We are listening to your voices. There are many more meetings pending,"" Tirador says was the biggest takeaway from the call. Tirador, who identifies her political affiliation as Democrat, says she believes a military intervention is just not doable. ""People who criticize what the Biden administration did yesterday do not realize how much political capital the president is spending on this,"" she said. Tirador feels that this is a time for action and the latest sanctions show that the president is interested in effecting change in Cuba. Ad But others believe the sanctions wont drastically change the situation. Andy S. Gomez, former University of Miami professor and author of the book ""Social Challenges Facing Cuba,"" said that the Biden administration missed a golden opportunity in the days following the Cuba protests. ""Its nothing more than to try and appease a segment of the Cuban-American community that was calling for him to do more."" Now the White House, he said, is trying to stop the bleeding. ""You are trying to put a Band-Aid on a cut that is 15-inches long when you really need stitches. Those marching in Little Havana said the sanctions are not enough. Alexander Perez /Kiwanis Club of Little Havana No food, no medicine. And the people arent even asking for that. They are asking for liberty and for freedom,"" said Alexander Perez of the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana. ""Thats the ultimate goal. I think that thats what the president should focus on and this administration has the power to change the outcome of Cuba."" Ad Meanwhile, many people are also wondering when the international community will step in.",['Hatzel Vela'],7/24/2021 1:35,"Cubans in Miami have opposing views on U.S. sanctions, some saying it's not enough","['sanctions', 'president', 'white', 'change', 'cuba', 'views', 'cubans', 'house', 'political', 'administration', 'opposing', 'saying', 'little', 'miami', 'tirador']","MIAMI, Fla. - One day after the White House imposed sanctions on the Cuban government, people marched on Calle Ocho Friday.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini MOSCOW, July 24 (Reuters) - Russia has sent a shipment of coronavirus-related humanitarian assistance to Cuba, including 1 million medical masks, the defence ministry said on Saturday, adding President Vladimir Putin had given instructions for the aid. Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, earlier this week reported the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare anti-government protests earlier this month on the Communist-run island. Two military planes carrying 88 tonnes of aid - including food and personal protective equipment, including over 1 million medical masks, departed from an airfield near Moscow on Saturday, the defence ministry said in a statement. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""On the instructions of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, military transport aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the Republic of Cuba,"" the ministry said. The ministry did not mention the United States, but with its aid to longstanding ally Havana, Russia could also be looking to make a point against Washington. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by decades-old U.S. embargo. Government critics say the island's economic woes are caused largely by the inefficiencies of the state-run system. Mexico said on Thursday it would send to Cuba two navy ships loaded with medical and food supplies, including syringes, oxygen tanks and masks, along with powered milk, cans of tuna, beans, flour, cooking oil and gasoline. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has blamed the U.S. embargo for fomenting the unrest in Cuba. With a population of 11 million, Cuba reported nearly 4,000 confirmed coronavirus cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average, in an outbreak fuelled by the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant on the island.

125,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/25/cuban-leftists-begin-to-turn-their-fire-on-the-harmful-practices-of-the-state,"Luis Emilio Aybar is a voice from the left, which in Cuba means pretty far left. By any measure, he should be a stalwart defender of the islands communist regime. After widespread public protests that two weeks ago roiled the nation, the 34-year-old published an article in the magazine La Tizza, which bills itself as ""a space to think about socialism"". After the prerequisite denunciation of the US, he wrote: ""What happened on 11 July is also because we communists and revolutionaries do not fight with sufficient force and efficiency the harmful practices of the state. ""We defend unity in a way that actually harms it ... We uncritically follow our leaders instead of rectifying their path. We agree to be disciplined, when what we have to do is think and act with our own heads."" In authoritarian Cuba, that sounded a lot like heresy. Cuba has always split international opinion. Its detractors are perhaps best represented by the US senator Marco Rubio, who called the island ""the only country in the world where Cubans cant succeed"". In turn, its supporters brook little criticism. Helen Yaffe, an author and academic from Glasgow University, recently arrived on the island, swiftly joining a government rally called by the government. Afterwards she declared on Novara Media: ""No one should underestimate the resilience of the Cuban revolution."" Within Cuba, the regime has long demanded such support, calling detractors gusanos, or worms. Yet the sight of thousands of Cubans taking to the streets to complain about a lack of food, medicines and electricity seems to have caused cracks to appear. Silvio Rodriguez is Cubas best-known singer-songwriter, a 74-year-old international superstar widely recognised as living his socialist values. In non-pandemic times, he stages monthly free concerts in the poorer barrios of Havana. Last week, however, he met the dissident playwright Yunior Garcia, who had been arrested during the protests. They discussed the unrest and the governments heavy-handed response. Shortly afterwards, Rodriguez called for the release of all those who had not resorted to violence. ""There must be less prejudice,"" he said. ""[There must be] more desire to solve the mountain of pending economic and political issues."" Carlos Fernandez de Cossio has blamed the US trade embargo for the demonstrations. Photograph: Ramon Espinosa/AP Criticism such as this has put the government on the defensive. It says the island has been subject to a wave of disinformation from the US. Carlos Fernandez de Cossio is Cubas point-man on the US, and second only to the foreign minister in importance at the ministry of foreign affairs. He insisted that claims that protesters had ""disappeared"" into jails and interrogation centres were just not true. ""There are people who have been detained and there are people that have been arrested, those that have violated the law,"" he said, although he would not give numbers. Independent media claim up to 650 people were detained, although many have now been released. Asked what he thought had brought Cubans on to the streets, De Cossio replied: ""Well, it wasnt capitalism."" The protesters had cried ""libertad"", freedom, and ""patria y vida"", homeland and life, the title of an anti-government song. The shortages they face are the result of Cuba running out of foreign currency, a situation hastened by the pandemic devastating an economy reliant on tourism. De Cossio blamed the 60-year-old US trade embargo, tightened to strangulation by Donald Trump and kept in place by Joe Biden. He said there had actually been more conversations with Washington during Trumps presidency than Bidens. ""Theres no dialogue at this moment,"" he said. Yet in his essay for La Tizza, Aybar strayed surprisingly close to another analysis, summarised by the Financial Times when it called Cuba a last ""lonely outpost of Marxist central planning"". ""During 2020, half of the countrys investments were allocated to hotel construction at a time when there was a drastic decrease in international tourism and an acute shortage of investment in agriculture,"" he wrote. He said 11 July needed to be a watershed. ""A failure to pressure the government from the left means that the right will take the initiative"", meaning ""more market, more private property, less education and public health."" Only time will reveal whether internal reform will satisfy the population. Another increasingly robust critic from within, Cubas former ambassador to the EU, Carlos Alzugaray, believes it will have to. He has just published an article saying it is ""essential"" that the government ""not make the mistake of blaming only external factors"". He was watching the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics on television as he pointed out that, despite the efforts of critics in the US, regimes such as China, Vietnam and Cuba have proved durable, and ""very difficult to overthrow"". It is his view that Cuba should follow China and Vietnam towards ""a market economy with socialist orientation"". Before he could get into that - or the governments potential reaction to the criticism from within - the pride in Cubas sovereignty that has always been a far greater and more unifying force than communism on the island revealed itself. The 69 athletes Cuba has sent to the Olympics appeared in the famous parade. Alzugaray faltered, his voice suddenly breaking with emotion.",['Ruaridh Nicoll'],7/25/2021 8:15,Cuban leftists begin to turn their fire on the 'harmful practices of the state',"['practices', 'state', 'harmful', 'called', 'begin', 'left', 'cuban', 'turn', 'foreign', 'cuba', 'island', 'cossío', 'cubans', 'cubas', 'wrote', 'international', 'leftists']","Luis Emilio Aybar is a voice from the left, which in Cuba means pretty far left.

126,https://havanatimes.org/features/pandemic-advances-fast-in-cuba-new-highs/,"By Circles Robinson Every morning at 9:00 AM, the National Director of Epidemiology of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, Dr. Francisco Duran gives the latest report on the Covid-19 situation. HAVANA TIMES - Only two days ago we reported records of new Covid-19 positives for Cuba. Now those figures are a thing of the past. On Saturday the new high was 8,853 with 80 deaths in the country of 11.2 million persons. In comparison, Florida, also spiking with new cases, has a population of 21 million and recorded 10,452 new positives on Saturday with 39 deaths. As testing apparently increased in the eastern part of the island, Guantanamo is now the most hard-hit province per capita. In one day, the new positive cases shot up from 642 to 1,181. The far eastern province has a population of 511,000. A first-hand report to Havana Times indicates that the number of sick patients in Guantanamo is probably far greater than had been previously reported. No independent questioning of official data is allowed in Cuba. Matanzas with 712,000 inhabitants had 1,461 new positives on Saturday, the second most per capita, and Cienfuegos with 407,000 was third with 794 new Covid-19 positives. Havana had 1,481 in a population of 2,129,000. The Public Health Ministry has warned that the numbers will most likely get worse before they get better. The 80 deaths on Saturday were a new high from the previous 67. Cuba is also facing a critical food shortage situation. People must wait for hours on end in long crowded lines to try and purchase something to eat at the US dollar stores. Others without that currency must resort to the illicit market at even higher prices. Failed farm policies have meant agriculture production has been dropping for years and now the government doesnt have the funds for imports. It had been importing 60-80% of the food sold on the island in its monopoly retail market run mainly by Cimex, the giant military corporation. Private import/sales businesses are not allowed in the state-centered economy. Meanwhile, even the most basic medicines are absent from pharmacy shelves, not to mention the crisis for chronic illness patients. Many Covid-19 patients are also without the medicines they need, as confirmed by our source in Guantanamo. The government does not allow any private pharmacies to exist on the island. In both shortages, food and medicine, a popular saying sums up government policy. ""No pitchean ni dejan batear"" (They dont pitch or let any one else bat). A recent decision, after the massive July 11 protests, to allow vacationers to bring in extra food and medicines in their suitcases and not have them penalized or confiscated by Customs, will help some families but wont scratch the surface of a nationwide problem for the overall population. Also, the number of flights is severely limited due to the pandemic.",[],7/25/2021 16:51,"Pandemic Advances Fast in Cuba, New Highs","['guantanamo', 'advances', 'pandemic', 'food', 'medicines', 'positives', 'reported', 'report', 'cuba', 'fast', 'covid19', 'patients', 'highs', 'times', 'population']","HAVANA TIMES - Only two days ago we reported records of new Covid-19 positives for Cuba.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - Demonstrations from those showing their support for people suffering from the crisis in Cuba are entering their third week. A rally was held on Sunday in Miami Beach at the intersection of 73rd Street and Collins Avenue. The group, holding Cuban flags and homemade signs, was getting the attention of passing drivers and spreading the message of ""free Cuba."" Organizers of the protest called it a peaceful gathering. At the event were not only Cuban-Americans, but people from Israel, Colombia and a host of other nations. Some people would like to see the United States doing more to help Cuba while many say that the world needs to see how people on the island are being treated. ""They should be free in their own countries and I welcome the day where I could go to my country of birth and enjoy it while its free,"" Cristina Moinelo said. ""Very difficult."" Another protest was held Sunday in Miramar. The crowd there also came out with Cuban flags and appealed for a better day in the communist country. Ad Just days ago, President Joe Biden issued individual, targeted sanctions against the regime in Cuba. Protesters even hit Washington, D.C. over the weekend near the White House to urge the U.S. to do more, and some Cuban-American South Florida members of Congress are listening. ""We must support them to be free. We must,"" Marsha Schwartz said. ""Its our duty to do so."" ""Its the world that has to say, 'Enough, we dont condone this,"" Moinelo said.","['Terrell Forney', 'Saira Anwer']",7/25/2021 22:18,Protest organizers hold peaceful gathering in Miami Beach for those suffering in Cuba,"['peaceful', 'say', 'showing', 'protest', 'beach', 'held', 'support', 'gathering', 'hold', 'world', 'cuba', 'moinelo', 'organizers', 'free', 'miami', 'suffering']","Demonstrations from those showing their support for people suffering from the crisis in Cuba are entering their third week.

Protesters from across the U.S. converged in front of the White House Sunday night in an effort to get the Biden administration to take a firmer stance in its effort to support anti-government demonstrators in Cuba. The Biden administration has announced its support of the protesters and has also leveled sanctions. The Miami Herald reported that even the protesters had different expectations of what the word ""more"" actually meant. Some went as far as suggesting a military intervention. ""We went into Kuwait, Somalia and didnt ask for anyones permission,"" Maria Fundora, the head of a Texas-based group called Cuba Libre, told the paper.

Representatives Maria Elvira Salazar, Carlos A. Gimenez, and Mario Diaz-Balart and Sen. Rick Scott are among the lawmakers who joined the demonstration. They met at 12:30 p.m. at Lafayette Square, and marched in front of the White House, and the Embassy of Cuba. A few of the demonstrators who said they couldnt travel with the caravans to Washington met in front of Versailles Restaurant in Miamis Little Havana neighborhood while Rudy Giuliani was visiting. There was another small group of protesters at the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami, as well as protesters and public officials at an event in Pembroke Pines. ""Obviously I am disturbed,"" said Broward County Mayor Steve Geller. ""They are rallying for the ability to speak without fear of being beaten or tortured, and this is what is happening. They are rallying for simple things like food and adequate medical care, which they are not getting anymore."" Ad Watch Christian De La Rosas 11 p.m. report: Cuban-American protesters continued to demonstrate in solidarity with those suffering on the island just south of Florida's panhandle. Last week, President Joe Biden and his administration committed to finding a way to provide uncensored internet access to Cubans and to issue U.S. sanctions against individual violators of human rights in Cuba starting by Corps General Alvaro Lopez Miera, who lead the crackdown on the July 11 uprising. Meanwhile in Cuba, Henry Constantin, the director of La Hora de Cuba, an independently-owned magazine, said officers arrested on July 11 in the city of Camaguey. He described the experience as, ""tough, annoying,"" and ""terrible."" Cuban American activists in South Florida said they had set up ""Cuban Missing,"" an organic database of alleged protesters. Diplomats from the U.S. and 20 other nations, including Colombia and Brazil, condemned Cuban authorities arrest and prosecution of protesters. Cuban American activists in South said they had set up ""Cuban MIssing,"" an organic database of alleged protesters.

132,https://nypost.com/2021/07/26/loud-protest-at-white-house-aims-to-push-biden-into-taking-action-against-cuba/,"Cuban Americans held a large rally outside the White House overnight from Sunday into Monday in a noisy bid to rouse President Biden to action against the islands Communist leaders. Biden, who returned to the White House from his home of Delaware around 4 p.m. Sunday, might have been able to hear the ruckus from his second-floor residence. ""Libertad! Libertad!"" a group of hundreds chanted after dark on Pennsylvania Avenue in a video tweeted by Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.). The Miami Herald reported that the White Houses outdoor lights -- red, white and blue to mark the Tokyo Olympics -- were shut off at midnight, but that the rally continued into early Monday. People rally in support of continued anti-government protests in Cuba on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House on July 25, 2021, in Washington, DC.

AFP via Getty Images Many of the rally-goers drove to DC in caravans from Florida. Loud protests can be unnerving to occupants of the White House. For example, an initial night of anti-police brutality protests in May 2020 after the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota prompted President Donald Trump to inspect an underground bunker. White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Biden could hear the protest as he tried to sleep.

She returned to the White House around 8 a.m. Monday after a trip to Japan for the Olympics. Anti-Communist Cubans have rallied outside the White House consistently since the largest anti-government protests in a generation broke out this month. Biden on Thursday authorized sanctions against one Cuban official and a Cuban government agency to punish a crackdown on protesters. Critics have called on the commander-in-chief to do more amid the suppression of protests -- and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told The Post last week that Republicans are weighing legislation to force the presidents hand. Biden previously said the US is investigating whether its technically possible to override an internet blackout imposed by Communist authorities. The lack of internet access prevents distribution of information on protests.",['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],7/26/2021 18:05,Loud protest at White House aims to push Biden into taking action against Cuba,"['dc', 'rally', 'president', 'protest', 'white', 'taking', 'biden', 'push', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'outside', 'loud', 'getty', 'aims', 'action']",Cuban Americans held a large rally outside the White House overnight from Sunday into Monday in a noisy bid to rouse President Biden to action against the islands Communist leaders.

133,https://www.foxnews.com/us/washington-cuban-embassy-protests-biden,"A sea of pro-democracy supporters descended upon the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C., Monday afternoon to demand an end to the communist dictatorship that has isolated the island nation from the United States for most of the last 62 years. The crowd, draped in Cuban flags and holding signs calling for freedom and liberty, chanted at the gates of the embassy on 16th Street, just blocks from the White House. ""People are dying,"" one protester told Fox News. ""Multiple times, Cuba has helped this country so it's time to return the favor,"" he added. BLACK LIVES MATTER GLORIFIED CUBAN DICTATOR FIDEL CASTRO One man wearing a shirt that read, ""Youre wrong, Joe, Cuba wants freedom,"" told Fox News that he would tell Biden to remove the team advising him on Cuba. ""He needs to get all [of] his advisers...get them out of there, and come here and talk to these people. We really know whats going on"" the man said. ""The advisers hes got? Theyre supporting communists,"" he continued. The Washington rally came after weeks of unrest in Cuba against the communist government over food shortages, a faltering economy and a resurgence in coronavirus cases. ""It's painful for me because I have family back there ... they're hiding right now because they don't want to be taken,"" another protester told Fox News. President Biden, who recently called Cuba a ""failed state,"" has come under fire for not doing enough to push for change in the reclusive country. ""At least talk about what is happening. At least say the truth. Give a press conference and talk about it,"" one protester pleaded to Biden.

134,https://nypost.com/2021/07/27/gop-seeks-meeting-with-biden-on-responding-to-cuba-crackdown/,"A group of Congressional Republicans wrote to President Biden seeking a meeting to discuss how the US can better respond to the anti-government protests in Cuba, according to a report. The 19 lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, requested the sitdown to determine how the administration and Congress ""can work together to bring an end to the oppressive communist regime in Havana and liberate the Cuban people."" ""Now is the time to act,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter  sent Monday and obtained by The Hill.  Hundreds of Cubans took to the streets earlier this month to protest food shortages and rising prices amid the  coronavirus pandemic, with many chanting ""Freedom,"" Enough,"" and ""Unite.""  On Monday evening, a crowd of Cuban-Americans staged a rally outside the White House  to encourage the administration to back the protests in the Caribbean nation. The GOP lawmakers said after decades of communist rule, ""this is a moment when the United States can change the course of human history for the better."" ""The United States is a bastion of freedom and democracy; a beacon across the globe for those seeking to cast off the shackles of communist oppression; a beacon across the globe for those seeking to cast off the shackles of communist repression,"" they wrote.

AFP via Getty Images ""We must support our Cuban brothers and sisters as they seek to take control of their future and liberate themselves from the communist malignancy,"" they added.  But the Republicans said ""this pivotal moment is being squandered by indecision, bureaucracy, and a failure to lead . "" The administration last week sanctioned a Cuban official and a government agency over the protest crackdown.  ""My Administration is imposing new sanctions targeting elements of the Cuban regime responsible for this crackdown -- the head of the Cuban military and the division of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior driving the crackdown -- to hold them accountable for their actions ,"" the White House said in a statement  last Thursday. The US also signed on to a statement with 20 other countries on Monday, condemning Cuba for arresting protesters.   "" The Cuban government has responded not by recognizing the voices of its own people, but by further stifling those voices through arbitrary detentions and secret summary trials lacking due process guarantees ,"" the statement said.   "" The United States will continue to support the Cuban peoples desire for freedom and to determine their own future. This joint statement demonstrates that the Cuban people are not alone in their aspirations ,"" it said.   Others signing on include: Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Guatemala, Greece, Honduras, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Korea, and Ukraine.",['Social Links For Mark Moore'],7/27/2021 21:44,Republicans seek meeting with Biden on better response to Cuba crackdown,"['states', 'meeting', 'republicans', 'united', 'biden', 'communist', 'cuban', 'lawmakers', 'cuba', 'house', 'freedom', 'seeking', 'better', 'crackdown', 'response', 'administration', 'statement', 'seek']","A group of Congressional Republicans wrote to President Biden seeking a meeting to discuss how the US can better respond to the anti-government protests in Cuba, according to a report.

Brig. Gen. Armando Choy Rodriguez, 87, was the latest aging revolutionary to die, with Marta Abreu Central University announcing on Twitter that he passed away Monday. Rodriguez was the founder of the ""July 26 Movement"" in Las Villas, and an author and historian, WPLG-TV in Miami said. Also on Monday, Manuel Eduardo Lastres Pacheco, a former general who served under Argentine Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara during the revolution in the late 1950s, passed away, Cuban television confirmed. Pacheco later served as commander of Cubas eastern army. On Saturday, Gen. Ruben Martinez Puente, a 79-year-old general in Cubas army reserve and a controversial figure in the military, also died. Puente was the general who gave the order to shoot down a civilian plane from the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue in 1996 -- bringing tensions with the US to a fever pitch. Marcelo Verdecia Perdomo, another army reserve brigadier general and a former Castro bodyguard, died on July 20, the Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Finally, Agustin Pena Porres, former commander of the western army and a member of Cubas Communist Central Committee, passed away on July 17, WPLG said. Manuel Eduardo Lastres Pacheco, who served under Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara in the 1950s, was one of the generals who passed away. AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa According to Florida-based news outlet Periodico Cubano, the deaths follow that of Brig. Gen. Ivan Duponte Cabrales in May at the age of 77. The more recent deaths come in the wake of massive protests in the Communist country earlier this month, with thousands of Cubans taking to the streets to demand freedom, food, and medications -- including COVID vaccines. The global pandemic has spiked in the past month, with new daily cases jumping from 1,880 on June 24 to 7,732 one month later. Overall, Cuba has had more than 340,000 coronavirus cases and 2,417 deaths since the outbreak of the deadly virus last year, WPLG said. Cuban government officials have not said if the recent deaths of the five military leaders were linked to the virus. -",['Social Links For Jorge Fitz-Gibbon'],7/27/2021 22:30,Five high-ranking Cuban generals dead in 10 days,"['highranking', 'generals', 'deaths', 'passed', 'served', 'military', 'cuban', 'gen', 'away', 'month', 'general', 'cubas', 'days', 'dead']","Five high-ranking military leaders died in the span of just 10 days, according to the Cuban government -- though its remained mum on the causes.

136,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/cuba-generals-deaths-covid-19-coronavirus,"Five mostly elderly and retired Cuban military generals have died in recent days in mysterious circumstances, the countrys communist regime has confirmed, adding intrigue to a new round of freedom protests taking place in the island and US. There is no suggestion of foul play in the deaths of the five, one of whom was the former head of Cubas air force when it shot down two American private planes in the infamous 1996 Brothers to the Rescue outrage. But with Covid-19 surging across the island, and the average number of daily new cases in Cuba close to 8,000, almost eight times higher than the beginning of July, observers fear that the pandemic could be responsible. The youngest of the generals was 57. Cubas government has not given an explanation or cause of death for any of the five. According to the Miami Herald, which first reported the story, the deaths came within days of anti-government protests across Cuba, the largest show of public dissent against the regime in decades. The demise of the generals also caught the attention of Floridas senior senator Marco Rubio, whose parents immigrated from Cuba in the 1950s, before Fidel Castros 1959 communist revolution. ""Nine days. Five dead generals in #Cuba. Very strange,"" he tweeted on Tuesday, following up an earlier tweet in which he noted that high-ranking military officials ""have had some incredibly bad luck recently"". Rubio has been one of the most vocal politicians against the Cuban government in Florida, home to more than 1.5m exiles and first and second-generation Cuban-Americans, and has joined recent protests in Miamis Little Havana neighborhood. The best-known of the five is Ruben Martinez Puente, 79, a former chief of the Cuban air force who was indicted in Miami in 2003 but never faced trial for the incident seven years earlier in which two pilots and two other passengers were killed when a Cuban military jet shot down their Cessna planes in international waters. Martinez Puente died on 24 July, the Herald reported, citing a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba memorandum. The others, the newspaper said, included Agustin Pena Porrez, a former head of Cubas eastern army, who died on 17 July at the age of 57. It said the communist party newspaper Granma published pictures of his funeral and quoted a tweet by Cuban leader Miguel Diaz-Canel saying the death was ""sad news."" Marcelo Verdecia, a retired brigadier general and former Castro bodyguard, died 20 July in Santa Clara. Retired brigadier general Eduardo Lastres Pacheco died on Monday this week, and on Tuesday the Twitter account of the university of Las Villas reported the death of retired brigadier general Armando Choy Rodriguez, 87. No ages were given for Verdecia or Lastres Pacheco.",['Richard Luscombe'],7/28/2021 19:25,Five Cuban generals dead in recent days - is the Covid spike to blame?,"['generals', 'died', 'military', 'recent', 'cuban', 'protests', 'covid', 'cuba', 'blame', 'retired', 'general', 'death', 'reported', 'days', 'dead', 'spike']","Five mostly elderly and retired Cuban military generals have died in recent days in mysterious circumstances, the countrys communist regime has confirmed, adding intrigue to a new round of freedom protests taking place in the island and US.

137,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/29/cuba-responds-protests-3-extra-pounds-rice-rations-no-extra-freedom/,"The Ministry of Interior Commerce in Cuba announced Wednesday that it would increase rice rations by an extra three pounds per person per month, an attempt to quell the eruption of anti-communist unrest that has persisted since July 11. That day, thousands of Cubans nationwide -- in nearly every city on the island -- organized peaceful marches calling for the end of the communist Castro regime, which has used executions, torture, and imprisonment to stay in power since 1959. The scope of the protests attracted international attention and has triggered ongoing protests by Cubans in the diaspora in major capitals around the world, most prominently in Washington, D.C. The protesters chanted slogans like ""freedom"" and anti-communist phrases, plainly stating opposition to the regime. The Communist Party of Cuba has attributed the protests to alleged illicit American intelligence activity, without providing any evidence for U.S. involvement, while international leftist groups sympathetic to the regime have claimed the protesters were objecting to an increasingly dire economic situation in the country that they, too, blamed on the United States. The administration of President Joe Biden adopted the false claim that the protesters were objecting to a deteriorating Chinese coronavirus situation. Attempting to fuel the narrative that the protesters were demanding an improved economic situation, the Ministry of Interior Commerce (MINCIN) announced a giveaway of a paltry three extra pounds of rice per person every month from August to December. Minister Betsy Diaz Velazquez said at a press conference that the extra food rations were in part possible due to humanitarian aid from Russia and Nicaragua, allied leftist regimes. Diaz explicitly connected the rations to the protests, stating the government sought ""in this way to begin giving the population a level of satisfaction at a time in which the imperialism [the United States] is trying to create irritation and disgust among our people and has a high responsibility in what is happening."" !!ULTIMO MINUTO!! Incrementar la oferta de alimentos es una prioridad para el gobierno, muestra de ello es que se entregaran3libras de arroz adicionales mensualmente por persona, garantizadas hasta diciembre, a partir de los ingresos obtenidos por las ventas en MLC. Abrimos hilo pic.twitter.com/N5BELuXvaZ -- Comercio Cuba (@MincinCuba) July 28, 2021 As a communist country, the Cuban Communist Country controls and distributes the nations food supply. Citizens receive ration cards that specify how much food each individual can purchase; it is illegal for individuals to independently decide how much food they need for their homes. Diaz also noted that families would have access to their August food rations early, according to the official newspaper of the Communist Party, Granma. The newspaper added that Diaz announced that it had received extra ""prime materials, like wheat flour, whose destination will be, fundamentally, towards local production industries to increase the output of bread and crackers."" The announcement did not specify any provisions of extra protein other than powdered milk for senior citizens and beans for four different provinces. The independent outlet Cubanet noted Wednesday that the general Cuban population met the announcement with outrage, noting it did nothing to address the core demand of the protesters that the communist regime leaves power. ""Every day they remind me more of Orwells 1984 with this increase by three pounds of the rice [ration] as if that represented the liberty and human rights that the people want, useless bunch of people,"" one social media user highlighted by Cubanet lamented. Diaz, the minister of interior commerce, has been one of the least popular members of the Communist Party leadership for years. Diaz outraged the general population in 2019 in an interview on state television attempting to address shortages created by poor management of food industries by the Party, particularly a shortage of flour that resulted from the government failing to repair aging wheat mills. The government blamed then-President Donald Trump for the shortages, without explaining what role he would have had in the mechanical failures, and cut rations for the majority of citizens. Diaz said on national television that, in addition to the United States, Cuban citizens themselves were responsible for shortages due to hoarding, adding most Cubans supporting receiving less food through the ration system. ""There are a variety of different opinions, most consider these [rations] good and even insist on us continuing to ration products,"" she alleged, prompting widespread indignation. The Castro regime has not supplemented its meager increase in rice rations with any reduction in human rights violations or restoration of basic freedoms for the Cuban people at press time. Following the protests, the regime enacted mass arrests and ordered state security officials to conduct violent door-to-door raids against suspected protesters. Those arrested, human rights groups have alleged, are being subjected to summary judgment trials with no significant due process safeguards. Police have denied the accused in many cases knowledge of what crime they are facing a trial for and access to an attorney. Those sentenced have said they have faced ""summary trials"" alongside as many as 30 other people and sentenced simultaneously. Those outside of prison have accused police of openly threatening them, including children erroneously arrested despite playing no role in the protests. Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez, a 17-year-old sentenced to eight months of house arrest for having witnessed protests she did not participate in, told Cubanet this week -- shortly after her release from one of Cubas most notorious prisons -- that police officers threatened to trap her in a room with two large men who would rape her. She was also subject to a strip search and forced to digitally penetrate herself while squatting in front of guards, allegedly to ensure she was not hiding a weapon. The parents of Yoel Misael Fuentes Garcia, a 16-year-old, told independent outlets last week that police visited the boy in the hospital to threaten him after police shot him on July 11. Fuentes was also not participating in the protests, merely peeking out of his home out of curiosity after hearing the tumult of the crowd. ""We, the relatives, had to see Yoelito through a glass in the hospital. Meanwhile, a police officer went directly to his bed to interrogate and coerce him,"" his stepfather told Diario de Cuba. ""He told him that they could take him to 100 y Aldabo."" 100 y Aldabo is one of Cubas most violent political prisoners and where Zequeira experienced her sexual assault and threats.

John Thys/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo HAVANA, July 29 (Reuters) - The European Union is ""very concerned about the repression"" of protests in Cuba and urges the government to release all arbitrarily detained protesters, the EU said on Thursday in its strongest statement to date on the matter. Summary trials have begun for those detained in unprecedented protests nationwide over shortages, power outages and a lack of freedoms on July 11, amid a deep economic crisis that has been exacerbated by the pandemic and U.S. sanctions. Rights groups have reported around 700 people detained, including several minors. The government has not given its own figures yet but denies that anyone was detained simply for protesting, rather on charges of public disorder, vandalism, contempt of authorities and other offences. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""We call on the Cuban government to respect the human rights and freedoms enshrined in universal Human Rights Conventions,"" the EUs top diplomat Josep Borrell said in the statement. It came three days after the foreign ministers of the United States and 20 other countries including a handful of EU member states condemned the mass arrests. ""We urge (the government) to release all arbitrarily detained protesters, to listen to the voices of its citizens, and to engage in an inclusive dialogue on their grievances,"" Borrell said. The EU has avoided public confrontation with Cuba over human rights issues ever since in 2016 signing a new agreement to normalize relations that no longer sought to coerce the Communist-run Caribbean island into democratic reform. The deal was part of a broader Cuban detente with the West. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter he ""strongly rejected"" the EU statement, which he criticized for not mentioning the ""genocidal U.S. blockade"" for which the government largely blames the country's hardships. Some of Havana's allies like Mexico and Russia have reacted to the protests by denouncing the U.S. trade embargo, and the Organization of American States had to postpone a special meeting on Cuba due to disagreement among member states over its treatment of the matter.

139,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/biden-host-cuban-american-leaders-discuss-response-cuba-protests-rcna1552,"President Joe Biden will host Cuban American leaders at the White House on Friday to discuss the recent historic protests in the Caribbean nation and his administrations response, including new sanctions on Cuban leaders and establishing internet access for Cubans. Those in attendance will include political and community leaders as well as artists. Thousands of Cubans throughout the island took to the streets July 11 and showed a level of dissent not seen since the 1959 revolution. The protests were sparked by the islands severe economic crisis, including shortages in food and medicine, as well as rolling blackouts, but also included calls for ""libertad"" or ""freedom."" Many chanted ""we want change"" and ""down with the dictatorship."" The protests ended with security forces and civilians with sticks beating protesters and arrests. Cubas government has largely blamed the United States and the decadeslong economic embargo for the protests and said demonstrators were also incited on social media. Over 700 people are being held by the government, according to human rights organizations. There have been reports of some people being held incommunicado and others receiving summary trials, which Cuba has denied. In the U.S., Cuban Americans have held protests and rallies in support of those on the island and called on Biden to take more action against Havana. The Treasury Department announced sanctions last week against Cubas defense minister and an elite brigade of government security forces that took part in the crackdown on protesters. The White House has held several meetings with Cuban American leaders and members of Congress since the protests swept through the island. Yotuel Romero, one of the performers of the song ""Patria y Vida,"" or ""Homeland and life,"" a phrase that was shouted repeatedly during the protests, will be at the meeting. ""Patria y Vida"" has become a sort of anthem in protests and is a play on the revolutionary slogan ""Homeland or Death."" Former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, eMerge Americas CEO and Roots of Hope founder L. Felice Gorordo and Miami Freedom Project co-founder Ana Sofia Pelaez are also expected to be in attendance.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) President Joe Biden announces from the East Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, July 29, 2021, that millions of federal workers must show proof they've received a coronavirus vaccine or submit to regular testing and stringent social distancing, masking and travel restrictions in an order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) MEXICO CITY (AP) -- U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with Cuban-American leaders Friday to discuss the recent social protests in Cuba, the possibility of new sanctions on its government and options for providing internet access to the islands population. The afternoon White House meeting, previewed for The Associated Press by an administration official, will take place almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest the shortage of products, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. Among the people who will meet with Biden is Yotuel Romero, one of the authors of the song ""Patria y vida!"" which has become a kind of anthem for the protests, said the official, who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans in public. ADVERTISEMENT Also present will be L. Felice Gorordo, CEO of the company eMerge Americas; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project, and Miamis former mayor, Manny Diaz, among others. The White House did not provide more details, only saying that new sanctions will be discussed as well as ways to establish internet access for the Cuban people. Internet access is a sensitive issue in Cuba. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls for antigovernment demonstrations on social media. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did so. Some U.S. leaders, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have said the White House should do something to maintain internet service in Cuba, including using balloons as Wi-Fi access points for the population. Jose Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watchs director for the Americas, said protecting internet access in Cuba ""must be one of the top priorities"" of the Biden administration. ""The growing access to the internet on the island has been a true revolution that has allowed the population to communicate, organize protests and report abuses almost immediately - something that would have been impossible a few years ago,"" he said to the AP. Regarding the sanctions, Vivanco said their value is ""mostly symbolic,"" because it is not realistic to think that they alone will change the situation on the island. He said one way to stop human rights violations in Cuba is a ""multilateral and coordinated condemnation,"" along with moving toward a policy that puts an end to the current embargo. In addition to the internet, the Biden administration is considering proposals put forward by U.S. advocates of trade with Cuba that would restore ways for Cuban-Americans to send money to relatives on the island. Biden and others have rejected the outright restoration of remittances because of a percentage fee of the transaction paid to the government. But under one proposal being considered, the transfer agents would waive that fee until the end of the year, according to proponents. The proposal would have to be cleared by the Cuban government, however, and it is not at all clear it would agree. Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the Minister of the Cuban Armed Forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""black berets"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. So far it is unclear how many people were detained in total, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people.",['E.

""Earlier this month Cubans took to the street in a show of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials and people disappearing who have spoken out,"" Biden said during the meeting, also detailing US efforts related to remittances, staffing at the US embassy in Cuba and internet access on the island. ""Cuban-Americans are hurting ... because their loved ones are suffering. And it's, quite frankly, intolerable."" The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced the sanctions earlier Friday, designated by the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The sanctions target Cuba's National Revolutionary Police -- the country's primary law enforcement body; Oscar Callejas Valcarce, the director of the police; and Eddy Sierra Arias, the police's deputy director. The sanctions, the Treasury Department said, ""were made in connection with actions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests.""

The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" President Joe Biden said at the start of a White House meeting with Cuban Americans not long after Treasury announced the sanctions. The administration says it is considering a wide range of additional options in response to the protests, including providing internet access to Cubans, and has created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that more of the money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the government taking a cut. Biden added that more sanctions were in the offing. ADVERTISEMENT The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. The Cuban regime deployed the PNR to attack protesters, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The police were photographed confronting and arresting protesters in Havana, including members of the Movement of July 11 Mothers, a group founded to organize families of the imprisoned and disappeared, according to Treasury. In Camaguey, a Catholic priest was beaten and arrested by the PNR while he was defending young protesters, according to Treasury. PNR officers also beat a group of peaceful demonstrators, including several minors, and there have also been documented instances in which the PNR used clubs to break up peaceful protests across Cuba, Treasury said. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Andrea Gacki, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""Todays action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights."" Among the Cuban American activists meeting with Biden was Yotuel Romero, one of the authors of the song ""Patria y vida!"" which has become a kind of anthem for the protests, said an official. Others present included L. Felice Gorordo, CEO of the company eMerge Americas; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project, and Miamis former mayor, Manny Diaz, and Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. White House officials said Biden would discuss the new sanctions as well as ways to potentially establish internet access for the Cuban people. Internet access is a sensitive issue in Cuba. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls on social media for anti-government demonstrations. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. ADVERTISEMENT Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. Some U.S. leaders, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have said the White House should do something to maintain internet service in Cuba, including using balloons as Wi-Fi access points for the population. The Biden administration is also considering proposals put forward by U.S. advocates of trade with Cuba that would restore ways for Cuban-Americans to send money to relatives on the island. Biden and others have rejected the outright restoration of remittances because of a percentage fee of the transaction paid to the government. But under one proposal being considered, the transfer agents would waive that fee until the end of the year, according to proponents. The proposal would have to be cleared by the Cuban government, however, and it is not at all clear it would agree. Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the minister of the Cuban armed forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""black berets"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. So far it is unclear how many people were detained, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people. ___ Castillo reported from Mexico City.

144,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/biden-meet-cuban-american-leaders-amid-calls-tougher-action-havana-2021-07-30/,"WASHINGTON, July 30 (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on the Cuban police force and two of its leaders on Friday in response to the Havana government's crackdown on protesters, and President Joe Biden promised Cuban-American leaders more actions were coming. The U.S. Treasury Department said the sanctions, which appeared to be largely symbolic, were a reaction to ""actions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests in Cuba that began on July 11."" Targets of the sanctions are two Cuban police force leaders, as well as the Cuban interior ministry's national police force, the department said. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""There will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate,"" Biden said during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders at the White House. His meeting came as the politically important community calls for more support for protests in Cuba that represent the biggest populist outpouring against the government on the Communist-run island in decades. ""The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" said Biden. Biden said he had asked the Treasury and State departments to report back in a month on how to allow remittance payments from Americans to Cubans without the Cuban government profiting. In addition, Biden has been working on a plan to try to provide wireless communications to Cubans and augment U.S. embassy staff in Cuba, a senior administration official said. The protests erupted this month amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of its old Soviet Union ally and a record surge in coronavirus infections. Thousands took to the streets, angry over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, which in recent years has tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island. He has said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns. U.S. President Joe Biden meets with governors virtually to discuss efforts to strengthen wildfire prevention, preparedness and response efforts, at the South Court Auditorium at the White House complex in Washington, U.S., July 30, 2021. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Last week, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions on Cuba's defense minister and an interior ministry special forces unit over allegations of human rights abuses in the crackdown that followed the protests, which saw hundreds of activists detained. Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have urged more measures. Participants in Friday's meeting included Yotuel Romero, a hip hop musician and author of ""Patria y Vida,"" a song that has become the anthem for the protesters; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project; and former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz. CUBAN AMERICANS SEEK TOUGHER POLICY Florida's 1.5 million Cuban Americans voted heavily for Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Winning back their support is crucial for Biden's Democratic Party to clinch the swing state in the 2024 presidential election. ""I think if Biden has a successful Cuban policy that is able to put the regime on the defensive and provide concrete support to Cubans, that will benefit him with voters in Florida,"" said John Suarez, executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba. ""If the regime collapses on his watch, that could be a game changer."" Guennady Rodriguez, 40, who said he moved to Miami from Cuba in 2013, said he thought Biden had moved too slowly in addressing Cuban policy in the months before the protests. The Biden administration has been engaged in a lengthy review of the Cuban policy it inherited from the Donald Trump administration. Rodriguez said Biden was unlikely to please Cuban-American hardliners without running afoul of liberal voters. ""Biden has put himself in a lose-lose position. Now it is going to be more difficult for him to select an engagement policy,"" he said. Alejandro Ortiz, 32, who also moved to Miami from Cuba, said he thought Biden's response to the Cuban government after the protests was too slow. ""I see an attitude that is a little passive,"" he said. ""He needed to be faster and more severe with his measures.""

145,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/us-announces-cuba-sanctions-biden-meets-cuban-american-leaders-rcna1567,"The Biden administration imposed new sanctions against two top Cuban officials and the Cuban National Revolutionary Police for their role in the crackdown against anti-government protesters in Cuba. The announcement came right before President Joe Biden hosted Cuban-American leaders, including Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Manny Diaz, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, at the White House Friday afternoon to discuss the sanctions and other aspects of the U.S. response the regimes violent suppression of peaceful protests. The Treasury actions against two Cuban police force officials, Oscar Callejas Valcarcel and Eddy Sierra Arias, were in response to ""actions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests in Cuba that began on July 11,"" according to the U.S. Treasury Dept. statement. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Andrea M. Gacki in a press release on Friday. ""Todays action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights."" Biden said that the governments crackdown amounted to a ""brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people"" and accused the regime of putting demonstrators in mass detentions and hosting sham trials. As part of the U.S. response, Biden said his administration was expanding assistance to political prisoners and exploring ways to bring internet to the island, as well as ways to increase the flow of remittances to the Cuban people without the military being able to take a cut. He also said there would be more sanctions in the coming days ""unless theres some drastic change"" in the Cuban regimes behavior, but added that he did not anticipate that happening. Cuban Americans have been denouncing the arrests of protesters in the communist-run island following historic protests on July 11, a rare event in the communist-run island not seen since the 1959 revolution. People march during a protest in support of continued anti-government protests in Cuba near the White House on July 26, 2021. Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images The protests in Cuba were sparked by the islands severe economic crisis, including shortages in food and medicine, as well as rolling blackouts, but also included calls for ""libertad"" or ""freedom."" Many chanted ""we want change"" and ""down with the dictatorship."" Over 700 people are being held by the government, according to human rights organizations. There have been reports of some people being held incommunicado and others receiving summary trials, which Cuba has denied. The protests ended with security forces and civilians with sticks beating protesters and arrests. For weeks, Cuban Americans have held protests and rallies in support of those on the island and called on Biden to take more action against Havana. Cuban Americans are an important voter bloc, and former President Donald Trump won a majority of their support in Florida. Cubas government has largely blamed the United States and the decadeslong economic embargo for the protests and said demonstrators were also incited on social media. In the U.S., Cuban Americans have held protests and rallies in support of those on the island and called on Biden to take more action against Havana. The Treasury Department announced sanctions last week against Cubas defense minister and an elite brigade of government security forces that took part in the crackdown on protesters. The White House has held several meetings with Cuban American leaders and members of Congress since the protests swept through the island. Yotuel Romero, one of the performers of the song ""Patria y Vida,"" or ""Homeland and life,"" a phrase that was shouted repeatedly during the protests, was at the White House meeting. ""Patria y Vida"" has become a sort of anthem in protests and is a play on the revolutionary slogan ""Homeland or Death."" CEO of eMerge Americas and Roots of Hope founder L. Felice Gorordo as well as Miami Freedom Project co-founder, Ana Sofia Pelaez, were also in attendance.

146,https://www.local10.com/news/2021/07/30/biden-administration-imposes-sanctions-targeting-cuban-leaders-for-violating-human-rights/,"WASHINGTON - The Biden administration targeted two individuals and the islands national police force in another round of sanctions on Friday, following the violent response to peaceful protestors during the historic protests on the communist island July 11. Cuban Police director Oscar Callejas Valcarce, his deputy Eddy Sierra Arias and the National Police Force, la Policia Nacional Revolucionaria, are facing human rights violations and sanctions, blocking the ownership of property or interests in the United States, in any way associated with the individuals or the communist regime on the island. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Andrea M. Gacki. ""Todays action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights,"" the statement continued. Ad The administration says it is considering a wide range of additional options in response to the protests, including providing internet access to Cubans, and has created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that more of the money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the government taking a cut. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls on social media for antigovernmental demonstrations. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. Ad Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the minister of the Cuban armed forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""boinas regras"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. Several Cuban Americans were in attendance during Fridays meeting, including entertainers Emilio Estefan, Yotuel Romero and former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, now the Chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. Diaz applauded the sanctions. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Ad Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. Human rights groups report more than 700 arrests and 500 people still in custody following the protests, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people. The communist regime blames America and the economic embargo for the recent protests, but U.S. leaders pushed back saying they were the result of the countrys economic crisis.","['Ben Kennedy', 'Veronica Crespo', 'Associated Press']",7/30/2021 21:33,Biden administration imposes sanctions targeting Cuban leaders and national police for violating human rights,"['sanctions', 'rights', 'leaders', 'national', 'imposes', 'biden', 'communist', 'cuban', 'protests', 'human', 'twitter', 'united', 'targeting', 'authorities', 'violating', 'took']","WASHINGTON - The Biden administration targeted two individuals and the islands national police force in another round of sanctions on Friday, following the violent response to peaceful protestors during the historic protests on the communist island July 11.

147,https://nypost.com/2021/07/30/biden-says-us-will-hit-cuba-with-more-sanctions-unless-theres-drastic-change/,"President Biden on Friday vowed to heap new sanctions on Cubas Communist leaders unless theres ""drastic change"" in the wake of large anti-government protests. Biden made the threat as he hosted a group of Cuban-Americans at the White House -- following weeks of noisy protests on Pennsylvania Ave, including a large and loud overnight protest into the wee hours of Monday. ""There will be more [sanctions] unless theres some drastic change in Cuba, which I dont anticipate,"" Biden told reporters at the Friday event. Biden said that Cubas repression of protests was ""intolerable"" and said that new sanctions are likely to target police on the island. But the broadcast of Bidens message was limited. The White House did not set up a live video feed for the Friday afternoon event and did not immediately provide reporters with a list of Cuban-Americans who participated. President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington. Susan Walsh/AP Biden last week authorized sanctions against Cuban Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Cuban Interior Ministrys special forces brigade, nicknamed the ""Black Berets."" Former President Donald Trump imposed sanctions against the entire Cuban Interior Ministry, including the brigade, in January, the Treasury Department said. It does not appear that those sanctions were lifted by Biden. Its unclear why Biden did not order sanctions against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who called the protesters ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"" and oversaw this months crackdown. Bidens original sanctions on Cuba sanctions have targeted Cuban Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Interior Ministrys special forces brigade. Susan Walsh/AP Critics have called on the commander-in-chief to do more amid the suppression of protests -- and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told The Post last week that Republicans are weighing legislation to force the presidents hand. Biden previously said the US is investigating whether its possible to override an internet blackout imposed by Cuban authorities. The lack of internet access prevents distribution of information on protests.",['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],7/30/2021 22:40,Biden says US will hit Cuba with more sanctions unless there's 'drastic change',"['sanctions', 'president', 'interior', 'white', 'change', 'biden', 'week', 'cuban', 'brigade', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'theres', 'unless', 'hit', 'drastic']","President Biden on Friday vowed to heap new sanctions on Cubas Communist leaders unless theres ""drastic change"" in the wake of large anti-government protests.

148,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/31/us-puts-new-sanctions-on-cuba-as-biden-meets-cuban-americans,"The administration says it is considering a range of additional options including providing internet access to Cubans. The Biden administration announced new sanctions on Friday against Cubas National Revolutionary Police and its top two officials, as the US looks to increase pressure on the communist government following this months protests on the island. The Police Nacional Revolcionaria and the agencys director and deputy director, Oscar Callejas Valcarce and Eddie Sierra Arias, were targeted in the latest sanctions announced by the Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control. The police are part of Cubas interior ministry, which was already the subject of a blanket designation by the Trump administration back in January. ""We hear the cries of freedom coming from the island. The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" President Joe Biden said at the start of a White House meeting with Cuban-Americans not long after Treasury announced the sanctions. Heidy Prieto, of Greensboro, North Carolina, crying as people protest the Cuban government at Lafayette Park near the White House in Washington [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo] The administration said it is considering a wide range of additional options in response to the protests, including providing internet access to Cubans, and has created a working group to review US remittance policy to ensure that more of the money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the government taking a cut. Biden added that more sanctions were in the offing. The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest against shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. The Cuban regime deployed the PNR to attack protesters, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The police were photographed confronting and arresting protesters in Havana, including members of the Movement of July 11 Mothers, a group founded to organise families of the imprisoned and disappeared, according to Treasury. White House officials said Biden would discuss the new sanctions as well as ways to potentially establish internet access for the Cuban people. Internet access is a sensitive issue in Cuba. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls on social media for anti-government demonstrations. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the US have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the protests, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. The Biden administration is also considering proposals put forward by US advocates of trade with Cuba that would restore ways for Cuban Americans to send money to relatives on the island. Floridas 1.5 million Cuban Americans voted heavily for Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Winning back their support is crucial for Bidens Democratic Party to clinch the swing state in the 2024 presidential election. Hundreds of people, many of Cuban descent, protesting the Cuban government at Lafayette Park in Washington [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo] ""I think if Biden has a successful Cuban policy that is able to put the regime on the defensive and provide concrete support to Cubans, that will benefit him with voters in Florida,"" said John Suarez, executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba. ""If the regime collapses on his watch, that could be a game-changer."" Guennady Rodriguez, 40, who said he moved to Miami from Cuba in 2013, said he thought Biden had moved too slowly in addressing Cuban policy in the months before the protests. The Biden administration has been engaged in a lengthy review of the Cuban policy it inherited from the Donald Trump administration. Rodriguez said Biden was unlikely to please Cuban-American hardliners without running afoul of liberal voters. ""Biden has put himself in a lose-lose position. Now, it is going to be more difficult for him to select an engagement policy,"" he said. Alejandro Ortiz, 32, who also moved to Miami from Cuba, said he thought Bidens response to the Cuban government after the protests was too slow. ""I see an attitude that is a little passive,"" he said. ""He needed to be faster and more severe with his measures.""",['Be Len Fer Nan Dez'],7/31/2021 0:32,Biden meets with Cuban Americans as US imposes new Cuba sanctions,"['sanctions', 'americans', 'imposes', 'policy', 'access', 'white', 'biden', 'cuban', 'protests', 'cuba', 'house', 'meets', 'administration']","White House officials said Biden would discuss the new sanctions as well as ways to potentially establish internet access for the Cuban people.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, July 30 (Reuters) - Cuba this week received shipments of food and medical supplies from allies Mexico, Russia and Bolivia in a bid to ease shortages and discontent amid the island's worst economic crisis in decades and a surge in coronavirus cases. The donations, which authorities started distributing on Friday, come nearly three weeks after unprecedented protests broke out nationwide, spurred by frustrations with dire economic conditions and curbs on civil freedoms. Cuba blames the unrest on U.S.-backed mercenaries exploiting hardships it says were largely brought about by decades of U.S. sanctions and disguising attempts at unrest through the campaign #SOSCuba calling for humanitarian aid. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Now it has taken back the humanitarian relief narrative, with the help of allies that have also blamed the U.S. trade embargo for much of Cuba's woes. On Friday, a Mexican navy ship carrying 1,000 tonnes of beans as well as medical equipment and oxygen for COVID-19 patients arrived in the country, which currently has one of the highest infection rates per capita in the world. Two more will arrive shortly, Interior Commerce Minister Betsy Diaz said late on Friday on state television. ""I want to personally thank President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who ... has ratified Mexico's traditional rejection of the blockade and its will to help Cuba,"" Cuban Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca said at the ship-receiving ceremony. Pedro Monreal, author of a popular blog on Cuban economics, said the relief was ""positive as an emergency measure"" given the seriousness of the simultaneous health, economic and political crises. ""This has a humanitarian and political angle,"" he said. ""But when you look at the long term, its relative weight is low."" Ricardo Torres, an economist with the Havana-based Center for the Study of the Cuban Economy, calculated, for example, that Vietnam's promised donation of around 12,000 tonnes of rice would yield some 2 pounds per Cuban.

150,https://havanatimes.org/features/the-protests-in-cuba-from-a-diplomatic-standpoint/,"Screenshot from a video taken in front of the Cuban Radio & Television Institute building on July 11, 2021. While many governments expressed concern over the violent Cuban government crackdown against peaceful protestors, they also oppose the US embargo on the island. By Laura Roque Valero (El Toque) HAVANA TIMES -The day after the demonstrations on Sunday, July 11, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, assured on national TV ""I can say that in general, the world has reacted with great respect and trust, which comes from knowing Cubas impeccable track record, always truthful and always transparent."" What has transpired the following days should oblige the foreign minister to qualify his discourse. The first declarations came from Cubas allies. On Monday July 12, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro expressed his support for Diaz Canels Government, while his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, forewarned threats of ""imperialist destabilization"" in the demonstrations in Cuba. Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, at first avoided commenting in his customary Morning Meetings on Cubas internal matters and self-determination. At the same time, he offered to send vaccines and humanitarian aid. Days later he made known his proposal to consider Cuba the ""Patrimoney of Humanity"" seeing it as an ""example of resistance"" in relation to the US blockade. However, from the moment the demonstrations began, other dignitaries noted that the protesters complaints should be heard. At the core are the declarations from the United States, due to the historic conflict between the two countries, and because thats where the largest community of Cuban ex-patriots is located. Shortly after the protests, President Joe Biden joined the call for freedom in a press release from the White House: ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" On July 12th, Wendy Morton, the United Kingdoms Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for European Neighborhood and the Americas, called for calm and openness so that the Cubans can express their opinions. On July 21, the UKs ambassador in Havana, Antony Stokes, met with vice-minister Anayansi Rodriguez of Cubas Foreign Ministry (Minrex) to discuss a wide range of topics, among them ""the right to peaceful protests, acts of violence, detentions, internal and external blockades, attacks on social networks, internet shutdowns, fake news, freedom of the press,"" in addition to Cuban vaccines, cooperation in regards to the pandemic, travel restrictions, and other bilateral and multilateral matters. Less reserved, Jair Bolsonaro, President of Brazil, referred from the very beginning to a ""cruel dictatorship"" that ""massacres"" freedom and ""peddles to the world the fantasy of a socialist paradise."" On July 13, Lithuania, Peru, Spain and Sweden followed the development of events expressing concern about the deteriorating situation in Cuba and supporting the right to protest. Chiles Foreign Ministry stated in a press release that there was no justification for silencing Cuban citizens with repressive measures. The following day, Portugal, Germany, Colombia and Uruguay also came out against the violence, and troubled by the first officially recognized death resulting from the protests. The concern regarding respect for human rights and democracy were repeated in these messages. On July 15, the communiques focused on the court proceedings against the demonstrators and their irregularities. The Netherlands and Switzerland called for releasing those who participated peacefully in July 11 protests. Also on July 15, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) condemned the repression and the use of force: ""The Commission maintains that official statements branding demonstrators as enemies are inadmissible and reckless. These statements stigmatize protest, foster an atmosphere that tolerates violence, may encourage clashes between citizens, and are incompatible with international standards to protect the right to protest,"" pointing out the duty of the Cuban State to guarantee this right, and its contemptable response of criminalizing it. Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed similar worries about the arrests and the use of excessive force against the demonstrators, and urged the Government to restore access to the Internet and social networks. Costa Rica, Ecuador, Canada, Poland and the Czech Republic also agreed about the lack of freedom and political rights of Cubans in relationship to their government. They petitioned for democracy, the end of repression, and for dialogue. Another point of agreement in several documents was to call for the end of the US embargo against the island. Poland, whose embassy in Havana has echoed the demand for the release of artist Hamlet Lavastida made by his 7-year-old son Leo, announced via its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a meeting with the Cuban ambassador in Varsovia, Jose Marti Martinez, in which (in addition to acknowledge the increase in bilateral commerce) the Polish vice-minister Przydacz communicated his profound distress over the recent events in Cuba, demanding an end to the repression and the creation of a dialogue. In response to the international reaction, Cubas diplomacy focuses on the ones in their favor. FM Bruno Rodriguez, summing up a conversation with his Canadian counterpart, Marc Garneau, said that Cuba expressed its concern over human rights violations to native peoples in Canada. Communication from Canada, however, states that Garneau expressed ""profound preoccupation for the violent repression of the protests in Cuba, in particular the repressive measures against peaceful demonstrators, journalists and activists, and the arbitrary detentions."" In addition to these individual statements, on July 25 a joint statement was issued by the Governments of Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Guatemala, Greece, Honduras, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Korea, Ukraine, and the United States of America. ""On July 11, tens of thousands of Cuban citizens participated in peaceful demonstrations across the country to protest deteriorating living conditions and to demand change. They exercised universal freedoms of expression and assembly, rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the European Convention on Human Rights. ""We call on the Cuban government to respect the legally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the Cuban people without fear of arrest and detention. We urge the Cuban government to release those detained for exercising their rights to peaceful protest. We call for press freedom and for the full restoration of Internet access, which allows economies and societies to thrive. We urge the Cuban government to heed the voices and demands of the Cuban people. ""The international community will not waver in its support of the Cuban people and all those who stand up for the basic freedoms all people deserve."" This declaration is a word for word match to a message that the Cuban Foreign Minister leaked on his Twitter account a few days earlier. Rodriguez announced that the United States, with Bolsonaros support, was pressuring European and Latin American countries to sign on. The final number, 21 signatories, is not an earth-shattering number for an international community comprising 190 countries. Yet, it is noteworthy that countries such as Greece, Austria and Cyprus, which rarely comment on Cubas political system, signed along with countries that abstained (Colombia and Ukraine) in the recent vote against the US embargo, in the UN General Assembly. According to some analysts, most of the worlds governments that have come out against the repression of peaceful demonstrators in Cuba prefer not to combine it with rhetoric like ""failed State,"" which the Biden administration brandishes. This is because they are also critical of the embargo, so they prefer to speak solely about civil rights in Cuba. Obviously, they have not remained silent.

151,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/02/cuba-human-rights-activists-confirm-1000-arrests-disappearances-since-july-11/,"The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), a non-governmental organization that tracks detentions on the island, documented over 1,000 disappearances or arrests in Cuba between July 11, the day nationwide protests began on the island, and August 1. The July 11 protests triggered a global rallying cry for international action to end the 62-year-old Castro regime, which continues to maintain a stranglehold on the island despite attempts to portray President Miguel Diaz-Canel as a new leader distinct from the Castro family rulers embedded in the Communist Partys most powerful military positions. The protests themselves, occurring in as many as 40 different municipalities across the country, were the largest Cuba has experienced in years and followed extensive civil society organizing by various pro-democracy groups since at least the 2003 ""Black Spring"" crackdown. While the July 11 protests were, by all accounts, overwhelmingly peaceful, Cuban authorities responded by deploying state security and its repressive ""black beret"" special forces to conduct mass arrests, open fire on crowds of dissidents, and perform public beatings to scare anyone considering joining the movement. Diaz-Canel also appeared on television on the night of July 11 issuing an ""order of combat"" to civilians sympathetic with the regime, encouraging them to physically attack anyone they considered may support the protests. Dissidents on the island have described the nearly three weeks since the July 11 protests as intensely violent. The ""black beret"" forces have conducted door-to-door raids looking for suspected protesters in nearly every major city and shot protesters in their own homes. The legal system is so overwhelmed, according to the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders, that courts are processing and sentencing as many as 30 people at once with no regard for differences in their cases and, in many cases, not granting them access to an attorney. Initial reports from Cuban journalists working on the island suggested that police had detained as many as 5,000 people in the immediate aftermath of July 11. Activists still insist this week that the true toll of those missing and arresting remains incomplete as so many remote towns in the interior of the country engaged in protests and so many of those marching are not known active dissidents with networks outside of the country. As of Monday, however, the OCDH tally is the largest known confirmed number of people missing or in police custody since protests began. According to the NGO, 1,004 Cubans remain missing or arrested as of July 11, the vast majority of them (795) men. At least 21 of those arrested or disappeared are children, the group noted, describing the last few weeks in Cuba as ""20 days of savage repression."" 1004 detenciones/desapariciones en #Cuba desde #11J 20 dias de represion salvaje 795 hombres (16 de ellos menores de edad) 209 mujeres (5 de ellas menores de edad). pic.twitter.com/PBBPjGrU5q -- Observatorio Cubano de Derechos Humanos (@observacuba) August 1, 2021 Cuban police appeared to arrest some of the most internationally known political dissidents first as protests began. Still missing, with no proof of life, is the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) Jose Daniel Ferrer. UNPACU is believed to be the largest pro-democracy group on the island, but no evidence suggests that Ferrer played any role in the protests. Ferrer is a veteran of the ""Black Spring"" arrests of 2003 and often faces arrest and disappearance, most recently disappeared in October 2019 and resurfacing 6 months later accusing the regime of torture and medical neglect in prison. The regime sentenced Ferrer to four years of house arrest in April 2020. Ferrer disappeared in far-east Santiago de Cuba. Also missing is the founder of the pro-democracy collective the San Isidro Movement, Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara. Oteros group was largely responsible for organizing large protests at the Ministry of Culture headquarters in Havana last year and suffers severe persecution, even though Otero himself has said that they ""do not want to topple the dictatorship."" Cuban police also appeared to disproportionately target religious leaders. The Cuban Communist Party is an atheist organization and has engaged in decades of intense persecution against Christians on the island. Groups like the santeria movement, who practice a syncretic religion largely based on Yoruba Nigerian paganism, have also endured persecution even among decades of rumors that Fidel Castro himself dabbled in santeria practices. In one particularly violent incident, Cuban authorities publicly beat a Catholic priest, Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, and cracked his head before detaining him in his native Camaguey, which experienced some of the largest July 11 protests. Police released Alvarez only after receiving international condemnation and, in his message following his release, the clergyman clearly sported visible injuries to the head. Still missing are several members of the Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba, a santeria group that refuses to worship under the auspices of the atheist Communist Party. According to the Global Liberty Alliance, a human rights advocacy group, at least six members were arrested for participating in protests. The OCDH estimated in a report published in July that Cuban repressive forces have performed over 30,000 politically motivated arrests in the last five years, many repeat incidents against the islands most vocal dissidents.

152,https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2021/08/05/watch-live-desantis-house-gop-leader-mccarthy-speak-in-south-florida/,"A visit to South Florida was aimed at pressuring the Biden administration into stronger action against the Cuban government. There were also clear political reasons for the show of force in Hialeah Gardens on Thursday. HIALEAH GARDENS, Fla. - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday that they ""will not back down"" as they push for democracy and freedom in Cuba and throughout Latin America. They spoke at a news conference in Hialeah Gardens after meeting with South Floridians from several Latin American countries earlier Thursday morning. Their message was aimed at ratcheting up pressure on President Joe Biden to proactively help the Cuban people. ""Mr. President, weve requested a meeting. Why? Because if you cant come up with ideas, we have them,"" Rep. McCarthy said. ""We can tell you the solutions. We will stand with you if you will act."" WATCH A REPLAY BELOW: Others who spoke at the news conference included Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez and U.S. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Salazar of South Florida. House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Mike McCaul (Texas) and fellow U.S. Reps. Mark Green (Tennessee) and Victoria Spartz (Indiana) also participated. Ad Earlier Thursday, the group met with members of the Cuban, Colombian, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan and Peruvian communities in South Florida to voice support for democracy in Latin America. ""DeSantis said what he has always said. Hes with the side of the Cuban people,"" said Ninoska Perez, who attended the roundtable discussion at Las Vegas Cuban Cuisine in Doral. ""He supports the Cuban-American community, and were really happy that hes the governor of Florida."" Perez was also impressed with McCarthys visit, saying: ""Its extraordinary that the leader of the Republican majority would come to Miami and see for himself what this community is all about."" It comes in the wake of widespread protests in Cuba last month that also sparked demonstrations here in South Florida. Thousands took to the streets of Cuba to protest shortages of food and medicine, restrictions on civil liberty, and the communist-run governments handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ad Gimenez, the former Miami-Dade County mayor, said he wants President Joe Biden to declare the Cuban government illegitimate because of its actions to punish protesters. Republican members of Congress are also pushing for the Biden administration to deliver internet to the island. ""If theres one message that were waiting for the Biden administration to do something about it, I have said it many times, we need two things: leadership and connectivity. Im talking about internet,"" Salazar said in an interview between the roundtable and the news conference. Asked how specifically the Biden administration help restore internet in Cuba, Salazar said: ""Well, the Biden administration can give the green light to those companies who have the technology to put up the balloons or whatever it is, satellite. Were not talking -- Im not talking about technology. Im talking about political willingness."" Ad Salazar later said that the news conference that ""patience is running out"" for what they see as Bidens half-hearted efforts to support Cuban dissidents. Biden has called Cuba a ""failed state."" He drummed up support from 20 nations for dissidents, set up a commission to study remittances, and has promised to look into restoring Cubans internet access. While the show of force by Republicans is part of an ongoing campaign to put pressure on the Biden administration, the Democrats are in fact also taking a hard line against the Cuban government. But the GOP has had a louder voice -- and more passion. ""Let the world see what is going on,"" McCarthy said. Theres also a purely political angle to this call for action in Cuba. The three Cuban-American members of Congress from South Florida are all up for re-election next year.","['Michael Putney', 'Madeleine Wright', 'David Selig']",8/5/2021 15:54,"DeSantis, House GOP Leader McCarthy pressure Biden to do more for Cuba","['south', 'desantis', 'salazar', 'florida', 'mccarthy', 'leader', 'biden', 'support', 'cuban', 'internet', 'cuba', 'house', 'talking', 'gop', 'administration', 'pressure']","A visit to South Florida was aimed at pressuring the Biden administration into stronger action against the Cuban government.

153,https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-cuba-143c4e13cf7a840c480c860682272757,"MIAMI (AP) -- House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and fellow GOP politicians accused President Joe Biden on Thursday of not doing more to help Cubans on the island get access to the internet. Internet service was cut off at one point during a July 11 protest against the communist government, but Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. Service is still spotty across the island more than three weeks later. McCarthy met in Miami on Thursday with members of the states Cuban-American congressional delegation, Republican Gov. and aspiring presidential candidate Ron DeSantis and Republican Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez. At a news conference afterward, Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said that while specific companies had expressed a willingness to step in and help, the White House has ignored the Cuban-American delegation. Salazar said ""patience is running out."" ADVERTISEMENT Biden has said the administration is working to identify options to make the internet more accessible on the island. Internet in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. The Cuban government restricts independent news media and censors whats available online. It also disrupts internet access. Last Friday, Biden announced new sanctions against Cubas national revolutionary police and its top two officials. The president also created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to make sure the communist government is not taking a cut of the money Cubans send from the U.S. to the island. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said last month that the government was not taking any of the money. Former President Donald Trumps administration took more than 200 actions against Cuba, including limiting individual trips to the island from the U.S., barring cruise ship visits and capping remittances. The Republicans gathered in Miami said Thursday that they were against lifting the caps. U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart said increasing remittances is ""something the regime has been asking for."" Diaz-Balart added that he had participated in previous classified briefings during which several options to improve access to the internet had been presented. He said he could not release any details, but that such measures had been used in other countries. Cubans used the internet to spread word on social media about last months anti-government demonstrations. Thousands showed up in Havana and other cities to object to government policies in large protests, the likes of which had not been seen in decades. ""Remember why you want to do this,"" McCarthy said of improving and maintaining internet access for Cuban residents. ""You want individuals, those in Cuba craving freedom, to understand we are with them.""",['Adriana Gomez Licon'],8/5/2021 22:20,GOP: Biden not doing enough to help Cubans access internet,"['president', 'doing', 'access', 'biden', 'used', 'help', 'internet', 'cuban', 'republican', 'island', 'cuba', 'cubans', 'gop', 'miami', 'working']","MIAMI (AP) -- House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and fellow GOP politicians accused President Joe Biden on Thursday of not doing more to help Cubans on the island get access to the internet.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo HAVANA, Aug 9 (Reuters) - ""Tired of having no electricity?"" read a post in a Facebook group for residents of the small Cuban town of San Antonio de los Banos on July 10. ""Fed up of having to listen to the impudence of a government that doesn't care about you?"" ""It's time to go out and to make demands. Don't criticize at home: let's make them listen to us"". The next day, thousands took to the street in San Antonio, a town of some 50,000 people, 30 km (20 miles) southwest of Havana, kicking off a rare wave of protests throughout the Communist-run country. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Unrest has been growing across Latin America and the Caribbean as unease spreads over COVID-19 lockdowns and rising poverty. But in Cuba authorities have traditionally tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by old Cold War foe the United States. The protests, Cuba's most widespread since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, appeared largely spontaneous as Cubans vented frustrations over long lines for food, power outages, medicine shortages as well as curbs on civil freedoms. Yet an investigation by non-state Cuban outlet El Estornudo - cited by state television and confirmed by Reuters - recently showed that the first protest was convened online by a San Antonio community forum for local people and those who had emigrated. The Facebook group ""City of Humor"" - the nickname for San Antonio which hosts a biannual humor festival - was first created in 2017 as a social space, according to one of its three administrators, Miami-based Alexander Perez. Over time, people also started expressing their gripes, said Perez, 44, a pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. That prompted him and the other administrators Danilo Roque and Lazaro Gonzalez to try to ""educate them"" about their civil rights and claiming them through peaceful protest. Neither Roque nor Gonzalez, whom Perez described as two younger men who lived in San Antonio operating under the pseudonyms to avoid reprisals, responded to request for comment. The backstory shows how the recent expansion of web access in Cuba has been a gamechanger in fostering forums on social media to share criticism and to mobilize. It also shows how strengthening relations with the Cuban diaspora - thanks to the internet and greater freedom of movement - is influencing politics on the island at a grassroots level. Virtual communities like ""The City of Humor"" exist nationwide and emigres are exhorting local people on them to keep on protesting and expressing solidarity, with some even urging violence. All this poses a challenge to the government which has allowed relatively unfettered access to the internet, unlike China, which blocks many Western social media apps. Cuba has blamed the protests on online meddling by counter-revolutionaries backed by the United States, which has for decades openly sought to force reform on it through sanctions and financing for democracy programs. The administrators of the ""City of Humor"" did not receive any U.S. funding nor had they coordinated protests with other towns, Perez said. Cuba, where the state has a monopoly on telecommunications, has suffered intermittent disruptions in access to internet and social media since July 11, in an apparent bid to prevent further unrest. Protests petered out within a couple of days amid those outages, a large deployment of security forces and a wave of detentions. TEACHING CIVIL RIGHTS Posts in ""The City of Humor"" - which jumped from around 4,000 to nearly 10,000 members after the July 11 protest - show users reminiscing, selling items, promoting businesses and complaining about local issues like water supply. Perez said the administrators decided three years ago to also attempt to rally the community to demonstrate over shared gripes, with little success. Last month they felt the time was ripe to try again. The pandemic and tighter U.S. sanctions had exacerbated Cuba's economic woes, plunging it into its deepest crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union. And the COVID-19 surge was pushing its already creaking healthcare infrastructure to the brink. ""We decided this was the moment,"" said Perez. The announcement of the protest at the church park at 11 a.m. spread by word-of-mouth and messenging applications, according to three San Antonio residents who requested anonymity. But Perez said he had such low expectations that anyone would show up that he went to the beach that day. So he was stunned to get a call to say the small early turnout had snowballed. ""We certainly never imagined that San Antonio would be the spark that lit the flame causing Cuba to take to the streets three hours later,"" he said. Videos on social media showed San Antonio protesters shouting anti-government slogans like ""freedom"" and ""we are not afraid"". ""My town came out in force because it just can't take any more,"" said one resident, requesting anonymity. Within hours, President Miguel Diaz-Canel himself showed up, in a bid - he said later in a televised address to the nation - to show ""the streets belong to revolutionaries"". Some videos on social media showed him being heckled but the unrest there and elsewhere soon dwindled amid a crackdown. Perez said a heavy security presence in San Antonio meant Cubans would have to bide their time until another protest. But it was noteworthy, he said, that the government already enacted reforms like lifting customs restrictions for travelers bringing in medicine and food in response to the protests. ""If we manage to achieve this in a few hours of protest"" he wondered, ""what happens if we spend three days in the streets?""

155,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/world/americas/cuba-government-biden-pressure.html,"President Bidens presidency raised expectations among many Cubans of a return to the Obama days, when the United States sought to bury the last vestige of the Cold War by restoring diplomatic relations with Havana and calling for an end to the embargo. Instead, Mr. Biden is taking an even harder line on Cuba than his predecessor, President Donald J. Trump, who tightened restrictions on travel and financial transactions. The island became an early foreign policy crisis for the Biden administration after Cubans poured into the streets to denounce their authoritarian government and the food and medicine shortages exacerbated by the pandemic. The rare act of rebellion was quashed with the biggest crackdown on dissent in a generation. The White House imposed new sanctions against Cuban officials in the past few weeks in response to the arrest of hundreds of protesters who took to the streets in cities across the island nation on July 11. Mr. Biden also asked government experts to draw up plans for the United States to unilaterally expand internet access on the island and has pledged to increase support for Cuban dissidents.","['Ernesto Londoño', 'Frances Robles']",8/9/2021 20:34,"Biden Ramps Up Pressure on Cuba, Abandoning Obama's Approach","['streets', 'states', 'president', 'white', 'ramps', 'biden', 'mr', 'cuban', 'cuba', 'island', 'cubans', 'abandoning', 'obamas', 'united', 'approach', 'pressure']","President Bidens presidency raised expectations among many Cubans of a return to the Obama days, when the United States sought to bury the last vestige of the Cold War by restoring diplomatic relations with Havana and calling for an end to the embargo. Instead, Mr. Biden is taking an even harder line on Cuba than his predecessor, President Donald J. Trump, who tightened restrictions on travel and financial transactions. The island became an early foreign policy crisis for the Biden administration after Cubans poured into the streets to denounce their authoritarian government and the food and medicine shortages exacerbated by the pandemic.

156,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-diaspora-sends-medicines-alleviate-dire-shortages-2021-08-12/,"Summary Cuba dogged by shortages of medicines, other basic goods Cuban diaspora volunteers in Spain and elsewhere send aid Cuba especially lacking in medicines to combat COVID infections MADRID/HAVANA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Wheeling two trolleys piled high with medical supplies, Marilys Colarte waits at Madrid airport to take her precious cargo to Cuba, where vital medicines are running low. Colarte is part of a growing international network of volunteers from the Cuban diaspora who have been transporting tonnes of aid to the Caribbean island in recent months. ""Everyone has contributed a little bit of themselves, a bit of their love,"" said Colarte, 52, before boarding the plane to Havana with 100 kilograms of supplies. ""I'm so happy to bring medicine to my people who really need it."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Built under the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, Cuba's universal public healthcare system is one of his revolution's most treasured achievements but a deep economic crisis has seen shortages of medicines and other basic goods. The government largely blames U.S sanctions while its critics blame the inefficient state-run economy. Last month the shortages, along with power outages and a lack of civil liberties, prompted rare mass street protests. read more One of the measures the Cuban government took in response to the unrest was to allow travellers to bring in medicine, food and sanitary products without paying import duties. In the two weeks following that move, travellers brought in 112 tonnes of such goods via Havana international airport, Cuban customs said. read more Volunteers welcomed that move but said its impact was limited given the few flights operating to Cuba after the government restricted them due to the COVID-19 outbreak. ""The biggest diaspora community is in Florida but we went from 50 flights per week from the United States to Cuba to three,"" said Florida-based volunteer Enrique Guzman Karell. Those flights were booked up until next year, he said, meaning volunteers had to fly via Madrid, from where there were more flights - an ""absurd, very expensive trip to deliver humanitarian aid"". BATTLING COVID At a church in Madrid, boxes piled high as volunteers sorted shipments donated by hospitals, pharmacies and individuals and bound for various Cuban provinces. 1/6 Marilys Colarte queues to check in two trolleys full of medical supplies to Cuba at Adolfo Suarez Barajas airport in Madrid August 4, 2021. Picture taken August 4, 2021. REUTERS/Juan Medina Read More ""People send requests for medicine via online messenger, saying 'I've got a relative who needs this or that' and they send us the prescription,"" said Massiel Rubio Hernandez, 37, an editor and organiser of the Madrid-based Ayuda Humanitaria Cubana (Cuban Humanitarian Help), one of the first organizations to coordinate relief. Over the past three weeks, the organisation has sent a tonne of medicines and other aid that is then distributed by other volunteers. ""We mainly send antibiotics and drugs which combat COVID-19 because there is just nothing there at the moment,"" said Hilda Landrove, a Cuban student who is part of another volunteer group based in Mexico City. Cuba is currently suffering one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the world, with confirmed cases over the past week ten times the global average. read more ""The doctors have prescribed my grandmother Azithromycin but there isn't any at the state pharmacies,"" said one Havana resident who declined to be named for fear of reprisals. He said he couldn't afford current black market prices he had found online - of 1,200 pesos (about $50) per antibiotics treatment - on his monthly state salary of 3,200 pesos. ""I can't let her die because of this shortage,"" he said. Even before the COVID-19 surge, Cubans had taken to queuing outside state pharmacies from before dawn to be at the front of the line when scarce medicine supplies arrived. Some barter for medicine on social media or use herbal remedies instead as preventable diseases such as scabies spread due to a lack of adequate treatment. Volunteers like Guzman Karell are calling on Cuba to allow more flights, especially from the United States, while they say the U.S. government should once again allow flights to cities outside of Havana. ""It's a drop in the ocean, given the chronic shortages,"" said Guzman Karell, ""but at least it's something.""

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini WASHINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Friday it was imposing sanctions on two Cuban Ministry of Interior officials and a military unit over the government's crackdown on protesters last month. The department said it was sanctioning Romarico Vidal Sotomayor Garcia and Pedro Orlando Martinez Fernandez and the Tropas de Prevencion (TDP) of the Cuban Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces. ""Todays action shines a spotlight on additional perpetrators responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights,"" said Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said TDP soldiers had been deployed ""and have reportedly attacked and beaten protesters, while making violent arrests."" ""The United States supports the people of Cuba in their brave call for freedom as we identify those who oppress them and attempt to maintain a repressive system,"" he said in a statement. ""We will continue to take actions to promote accountability for the Cuban governments human rights abuses."" Cubas Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Twitter rejected the sanctions, calling them ""U.S. opportunistic measures against Cuba's Ministry of Interior officers and Armed Forces Prevention Troops. Such measures reflect double standards of a government used to manipulation and lies to maintain the blockade against #Cuba."" In July, the United States put sanctions on the Cuban police force and two of its leaders. The protests erupted amid Communist-ruled Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of its old ally, the Soviet Union, and a record surge in coronavirus infections. Thousands took to the streets, angry over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, which in recent years has tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island. He has said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns. The U.S. Treasury earlier announced sanctions on Cuba's defense minister and an interior ministry special forces unit over allegations of human rights abuses in the crackdown that followed the protests, in which hundreds of activists were detained.

The decrees published in the Official Gazette follow the largest protests Cuba has seen in years, which broke out last month and apparently were fed in part by messages on social media applications. A decree signed by Communications Minister Mayra Arevich was meant to ""prevent, detect and respond opportunely to possible enemy, criminal and harmful activities that could occur in cyberspace."" It forbids spreading content that attacks ""the constitutional, social and economic"" rules of the state or that incite demonstrations or other acts ""that alter public order."" It also targets messages that justify violence or that affect peoples privacy or dignity. The decree also bans ""cyberterrorism"" aimed at subverting order or destabilizing the country, categorizing it as a crime of ""very high"" danger. ADVERTISEMENT It did not specify penalties, which are to be set in legislation later. But if offered a model form that people can fill out to denounce ""cybersecurity incidents."" Thousands of Cubans took part in protests on July 11 and 12, angered by shortages of food and medicine and by power outages, as well as some demanding more political freedom. The government accused outside groups and the U.S. government of using social media to cause trouble, and arrested numerous people -- officials have not given numbers -- as well as limiting access to the internet and temporarily cutting off access to cellphone data plans. While the new decree specifically deals with actions on the internet, Cuba already has laws that punish people for actions and statements that undermine its socialist system. The gazette also published rule against providing telecommunications services without official authorization, setting fines ranging from the equivalent of $800 to $1,600. In the past, the government often has cracked down on people who used clandestine satellite television dishes and decoders to pick up TV signals from the United States. In the wake of the protests, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said it is studying ways to give Cubans independent access to the internet. Republican critics have criticized Biden for not acting more quickly.",['Andrea Rodríguez'],8/17/2021 21:13,"Following protests, Cuba lays out laws on social media use","['decree', 'media', 'state', 'lays', 'access', 'internet', 'protests', 'cuba', 'using', 'social', 'following', 'laws']","Following protests, Cuba lays out laws on social media useHAVANA (AP) -- Cubas government on Tuesday spelled out its laws against using social media or the internet to stir up protests or insult the state -- and offered people a form to report offenders.

159,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rare-doctors-outcry-highlights-cubas-covid-crisis-growing-dissent-2021-08-18/,"A horse cart passes a flag displayed for the arrival of the Cuban medical brigade of the Henry Reeve Contingent from Andorra amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Havana, Cuba, July 1, 2020. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Several doctors in Cuba have taken to social media to decry shortages of medicine, oxygen and other materials needed to battle a dire COVID-19 outbreak, in a rare public denunciation of conditions in the island's hallowed healthcare system. The outcry comes in reaction to comments by government officials that the doctors say scapegoat medics for the country's worsening plight while downplaying precarious conditions pre-dating the current crisis. ""I want to denounce the collapse of our health system in our hospital as well as in the rest of the country, due to a lack of resources and protective gear,"" said Dr. Francisco Pavon in a video shared on social media, featuring more than 20 doctors and medical students in the eastern province of Holguin. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Others took to Facebook or messaging platforms to denounce the critical situation and demand more support from authorities. Similar criticism has been seen elsewhere globally during the pandemic as medical staff have reached a breaking point when infections have ballooned, overwhelming even the richest of healthcare systems. But in Cuba it is unusual, as authorities often restrict public dissent, saying unity is necessary to combat open U.S. attempts to force political change. And the topic is especially sensitive: healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of Cuba's ""revolutionary"" one-party system, having produced results on a par with rich nations. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged last week the healthcare system was overwhelmed. Cuba currently has one of the highest caseloads worldwide. The government has blamed tougher U.S. sanctions for worsening shortages on the island and slowing the roll-out of home-grown vaccines. But doctors' complaints have exposed simmering resentment over how rundown Cuba's healthcare system was even before the pandemic, with many blaming economic mismanagement not U.S. sanctions, as well as low salaries and other labor issues. Coming a month after unprecedented nationwide anti-government protests, rights activists say it is another sign Cubans are losing their fear of speaking up despite the risk of reprisals, like losing their job or being expelled from university. The growth of internet access in Cuba, providing virtual forums to share gripes and mobilize, has been key, they say. Diaz-Canel blamed last month's protests on the United States, accusing Washington of fomenting dissent online. But he also signaled he was open to reforms and a re-evaluation of Cuba's economic policies. 'SHAME ON YOU' While state-run media have published few details of Cuba's COVID-19 crisis, reports of incinerators breaking down due to excess corpses or deaths due to a lack of oxygen have been emerging in provincial outlets in the worst-affected provinces and on social media. But Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said he had heard more complaints during a visit to the central province of Cienfuegos about ""mistreatment and neglect"" by doctors than about scarcity. That, and statements by other officials alluding to doctors not showing up at their clinics or taking holidays in the middle of the crisis, proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back for many overworked doctors. ""Shame on you for criticizing those on the front lines,"" wrote Marian Vasquez, 23, a doctor and trainee-surgeon at the main Cienfuegos hospital, on Facebook. ""It's time you did more and criticized and lied less."" The country has long prided itself on having one of the highest ratios of physicians per capita, but many are deployed overseas. Now, the country is bringing hundreds back. ""Why the closed door meetings. Why did you not meet and dialogue with those on the ground?"" asked Miguel Angel Gonzalez, a doctor in Cienfuegos, chiming in with growing accusations among Cubans that government officials are out of touch with the people. He said the medics had hoped officials might be able to explain how they were supposed to work without enough equipment to do chest x-rays for all the patients in intensive therapy or the reactives to conduct basic tests. Government officials this week moved into damage control mode, underscoring their gratitude for the work of doctors and their efforts to increase oxygen supplies. ""What we have most proven in this time is the patriotism of our people, the healthcare staff, scientists. Working full time in complicated situations,"" wrote the president on Twitter. ""Thanks to all!"" Wearing a white doctor's coat, stethoscope around his neck and face mask, one doctor in the video, Rafael Alejandro Fuentes, said he was afraid, not of the pandemic, but of how government would interpret them ""demanding (their) rights."" State media said on Tuesday Cuba was updating its telecoms legislation to outlaw certain behavior on social media like publishing ""false news, offensive messages or defamation with impact on the country's prestige."" Cuba says it has the right to defend itself against U.S.-backed counterrevolutionaries seeking to overthrow it. However, some doctors saw this as an attempt to muzzle them and other critics. Access to internet and social media was also heavily disrupted in the weeks following the July 11 protests. ""We could not speak in public spaces,"" said one doctor working at a COVID-19 isolation center, on condition of anonymity. ""Now we can't do it over the internet.""

160,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/new-cuban-decree-tightens-controls-social-media-sparking-outrage-2021-08-18/,"HAVANA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Cuba introduced tighter controls on the use of social media this week, including a ban on publications that might damage ""the country's prestige,"" angering many citizens and international rights activists. Decree 35, published in the official gazette on Tuesday, comes a month after the most widespread anti-government protests in the Communist-run country in decades, which spread in part due to information shared on social media. The legislation bans the spread of false news or messages and content deemed offensive or which ""incite mobilizations or other acts that upset public order."" It also provides a channel for Cubans to inform on potential contraventions. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Those who have attempted to ""subvert the constitutional order"" will be considered cyberterrorists. It does not say what the penalties will be for violations. ""Our Decree 35 goes against misinformation and cyber lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who has blamed the July 11 protests on an online campaign by U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. Cuba analysts compared the measure to the totalitarianism of George Orwell's ""1984"", saying that they feared the vague definitions of what constitutes a violation would allow for arbitrary implementation. Since the introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago, platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp have enabled Cubans to share their gripes and even mobilize in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. ""Cuba is formalizing digital repression,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty's Americas director, noting the state already had monopoly over internet access, which was curtailed during and following the July 11 protests. Nicaragua passed similar ""cyber crime"" legislation last year and has used it to muzzle opposition, she said. Cuba's new decree explicitly orders the state telecoms monopoly to suspend services to users who have committed contraventions, in coordination with relevant authorities. 1/4 People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Read More 'WE CAN'T EVEN TALK' Cuban officials have long argued that dialogue is permitted but only ""within the revolution,"" to present a unified front against the United States, which has long openly sought to force political change in the country. Last month, the U.S. government said it was working with the private sector and Congress to look for ways to make the internet more accessible to the people of Cuba. Some Cuban Americans have used social media to encourage Cubans on the island to rise up against the government, with a few even urging then to commit acts of sabotage. But many young Cubans say that should not be an excuse for them to be banned from expressing themselves and have taken to social media to criticize the new measure, enacted a month after protests that resounded with cries of ""freedom."" ""Now we can't even talk,"" said one doctor, on condition of anonymity, who had participated in a video denouncing dire working conditions amid Cuba's COVID-19 crisis. The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday Cuba should ""not punish those who speak the truth"" while the British ambassador to Havana, Antony Stokes, wrote on Twitter that the recent crackdown on protesters and the censorship embodied by Decree 35 would ""silence legitimate voices."" Canada-based Cuban legal analyst Eloy Viera said Decree 35 outlined regulations rather than updated the penal code, so would not result in jailtime for those found transgressing. But it was a more severe and explicitly political measure to regulate online expression than a previous, 2019 decree that bans the ""spreading of information contrary to the common good, morals, decency, and integrity,"" he said. Government critics have faced fines under that decree, said Viera. But ultimately it had not been effective and neither, likely, would Decree 35, he said. ""They won't be able to apply it to all the discontent of Cubans, who have found in social media a space that does not exist in the country's public places,"" said Viera.
