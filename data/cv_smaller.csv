0,China pneumonia outbreak: Mystery virus probed in Wuhan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50984025,1/3/2020,www.bbc.com,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The outbreak has occurred in the city of Wuhan

Chinese authorities have launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia which has infected dozens of people in the central city of Wuhan.

A total of 44 cases have been confirmed so far, 11 of which are considered ""severe"", officials said on Friday.

The outbreak has prompted Singapore and Hong Kong to bring in screening processes for travellers from the city.

It comes amid online fears the virus could be linked to Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.

The potentially deadly, flu-like Sars virus killed more than 700 people around the world in 2002-03, after originating in China.

There has been speculation on social media about a possible connection to the highly contagious disease.

Wuhan police said eight people had been punished for ""publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification"".

The Wuhan health commission said on Friday it was investigating the cause of the outbreak.

In a statement on its website, it said it had already ruled out a number of infection sources - including influenza, avian influenza and common respiratory diseases - but did not mention Sars.

There has also been no human-to-human transmission, the statement added. However, a number of those infected worked at a seafood market in the city, leading authorities to clean the area.

A spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was aware of the outbreak and was in contact with the Chinese government.

""There are many potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus,"" the spokesman added. ""WHO is closely monitoring this event and will share more details as we have them. ""

Fears sparked by an older epidemic

Analysis by BBC Health's Philippa Roxby

This latest outbreak appears to have sparked memories for those who dealt with a Sars epidemic 18 years ago.

At the time, the WHO criticised China for under-reporting the number of cases of Sars in a southern Chinese province.

In the 2002-03 epidemic, the virus affected more than 8,000 people in 26 countries, killing 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong.

Travellers flying to other countries are thought to have been behind the large number of cases in that outbreak because Sars spreads quickly without swift treatment in hospital.

China sacked its health minister at the time for the poor handling of the crisis.

The country has been free of Sars since May 2004.","[-2.33086105e-02  5.09259216e-02  9.89757478e-03  6.31533042e-02

A mysterious viral pneumonia that has infected dozens in central China is not Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), health chiefs have said.

They also discounted bird flu and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and said investigations were continuing.

A total of 59 cases have been reported in the city of Wuhan, seven of which are considered critical.

The outbreak prompted Singapore and Hong Kong to bring in screening processes for travellers from the city.

An epidemic of the potentially deadly, flu-like Sars virus killed more than 700 people around the world in 2002-03, after originating in China.

In a statement posted on its website late on Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 163 people who had had contact with those infected had been placed under medical observation. It said efforts were continuing to identify the virus and its source.

The commission said previously that there had been no human-to-human transmission of the illness. It added that a number of those infected worked at a seafood market in the city, leading authorities to sanitise the area.

Singapore and Hong Kong have both set up systems to check travellers arriving from Wuhan for possible fever.

Hong Kong has admitted 16 travellers with pneumonia-like symptoms to hospital, the South China Morning Post reported, but none have so far been found to have the unidentified strain. Singapore has had one suspicious case, it added.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is aware of the outbreak and is in contact with the Chinese government.

""There are many potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus,"" a spokesman said last week.

2,China reports first death from mysterious outbreak in Wuhan,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/china-reports-death-mysterious-outbreak-wuhan-200111023325546.html,1/10/2020,www.aljazeera.com,"A 61-year-old man has died from pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in an outbreak of a yet to be identified virus while seven others are in critical condition, the Wuhan health authorities said on Saturday.

In total, 41 people have been diagnosed with the pathogen, which preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media earlier this week pointed to a new type of coronavirus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on its website.

More:

Two of them have been discharged from hospital and the rest are in a stable condition, while 739 people deemed to have been in close contact with the patients have been cleared, it said.

The man who died was a regular buyer at the seafood market, and had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease, it said.

Treatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of January 9 when his heart failed.

The commission added that no new cases had been detected since January 3.

The Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at a seafood market in the city, and that to date, no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found.

The World Health Organization said on Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.

The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad.

The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via aeroplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.

The Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and, as of Friday, had completed nucleic acid tests.","[-4.23171073e-02  6.09870628e-02  8.87921918e-03  5.83692975e-02

3,Japan confirms first case of coronavirus infection,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/japan-confirms-case-coronavirus-infection-200116012730381.html,1/15/2020,www.aljazeera.com,"Japan has confirmed the first case of infection from the new coronavirus that been reported in China, the health ministry announced on Thursday.

A man in his 30s from Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, tested positive, the ministry said.

The man had been to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where there has been an outbreak of pneumonia believed to be caused by the new coronavirus strain, it said.

More:

He reportedly returned from China to Japan with a fever and was hospitalised. He was released on Wednesday after the symptoms subsided, according to the health ministry statement.

The World Health Organization (WHO) had earlier warned that the new virus could spread and alerted hospitals worldwide.

On Monday, a Chinese woman was also ordered quarantined in Thailand after contacting the virus, authorities said.

Authorities in Asia have stepped up monitoring at airports ahead of next week's Lunar New Year holiday when hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists are expected to travel domestically and abroad.

On Wednesday, the US State Department also issued a health alert about travel to the Wuhan region. It referenced a Watch Level 1 Alert by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions.

On Saturday, Chinese authorities announced that a 61-year-old man died from pneumonia, a symptom of the disease, in Wuhan.

In total, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in China, which preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media show could have been caused by a new type of coronavirus.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can lead to infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe. SARS originated in southern China in 2002 and infected more than 8,000 people in 37 countries before it was brought under control. Nearly 800 people died.

""The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,"" WHO said in a statement.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been consulting international experts on the public health risks of the outbreak to decide whether an emergency meeting is needed, it said.","[-3.89743759e-03  5.57561405e-02  3.07840351e-02  1.00770518e-01

4,CDC to screen at three US airports for signs of new virus from China,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/17/health/wuhan-virus-us-airport-screenings-china-bn/index.html,1/17/2020,edition.cnn.com,"(CNN) More than 100 staffers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being deployed to three US airports to check passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for fever and other symptoms of a mysterious new virus that's killed two and infected dozens in China, the CDC announced Friday.

It's a highly unusual step. The last time the CDC did routine passenger health screening was during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, according to Dr. Martin Cetron , director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine.

""I've been here since 1996, and that's the only other time we've ever done this -- for Ebola,"" Cetron said.

The screenings at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport will start tonight, and screenings at San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport will begin Saturday. The CDC will look for symptoms such as coughing and difficulty breathing and check temperatures of each passenger with an infrared thermometer.

The CDC took these steps after travelers from Wuhan recently arrived in Thailand and Japan infected with the new virus. There have been two cases in Thailand and one in Japan.

""Considering global travel patterns, additional cases in other countries are likely,"" the World Health Organization stated in a press release Thursday.

Last year, more than 60,000 passengers flew into the United States from Wuhan, a city 700 miles south of Beijing. The vast majority flew into the three airports where the checks will take place, according to the CDC.

January is the peak travel season from China to the United States because of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Cetron said.

Cetron described the airport screenings as part of a set ""proactive preparedness precautions.""

""We believe the current risk to this virus is low,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a press conference on Friday. ""For families sitting around the dinner table tonight, this is not something they need to worry about.""

At this point, it appears most people caught the virus directly from animals, and the infection does not spread very easily from person to person.

""This is not a time for people to freak out and be overly concerned,"" Cetron said. ""This is a time for vigilance and awareness.""

He added that much more common illnesses, such as the flu, are ""much bigger threats"" to Americans than the new virus from China.

""I'm fully aware that the unknown is more of a source of anxiety than that which is already defined,"" he said. ""But we should not freak out.""

What we know about the new virus

So far, two people in China have died from this new virus, officially called the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Some 45 people in China have become infected. Some have developed pneumonia.

Coronaviruses, such as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome , are common in many species of animals, including camels and bats. Sometimes -- but rarely -- they evolve and infect humans as well.

Chinese health authorities have reported that most of the patients in Wuhan had visited a large seafood and animal market. However, some patients in the outbreak reportedly had not been to animal markets, which suggests that ""some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring,"" according to the CDC.

At least for now, that spread appears to be quite limited. Cetron said it's ""reassuring"" that Chinese authorities report that no health care workers who've cared for the patients have become infected, and that some 700 other contacts of patients have also not become ill.

""This isn't anywhere near in the same category as measles or flu,"" Cetron said. Those two infections spread easily from person to person.

To learn more about this new virus, health authorities are taking a close look at SARS.

In 2003, SARS spread to more than two dozen countries in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Worldwide, more than 8,000 people became sick and 774 died. In the United States, there were 29 SARS cases and no deaths, according to the CDC

SARS did spread person to person through close contact such as kissing, sharing utensils or talking to someone within 3 feet.

Cetron emphasized that this new virus may be different from its cousin and behave in unexpected ways.

""We have to have humility and appreciate that it may be different. We can't just assume that what we know from previous viruses will always apply,"" he said.

New screening procedures

Cetron said he expects that ""the vast majority"" of passengers arriving from Wuhan will be healthy. CDC will give them information in English and Mandarin about what symptoms to look for over the next two weeks.

After further investigation, travelers that are symptomatic will be sent to local hospitals that work with the CDC.

Cetron said the symptoms of the new virus are so common that he expects the screenings will catch many more people with the flu or other winter viruses than with the new coronavirus.

If it turns out someone does have the new virus, they'll be isolated in the hospital.

He added that while there are still many questions about this new virus -- its incubation period, for example, or how easily it spreads from person to person -- the progress on it in such a short time has been impressive, including a sequencing of the virus' genome

""It's quite remarkable to me that from a cluster of pneumonia detected just a little over a month ago in Wuhan, China, we have fully sequenced the virus and have some diagnostic capability to test for it,"" he said.","[ 7.04639703e-02 -2.73922719e-02 -2.30043917e-03  2.11994294e-02

5,China confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/china-confirms-human-human-transmission-coronavirus-200120162507948.html,1/20/2020,www.aljazeera.com,"Human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus strain has been confirmed in China, fueling fears of a major outbreak of the SARS-like virus as millions travel for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health Commission, said on Monday patients may have contracted the new virus without having visited the central city of Wuhan where it was discovered before spreading across China and reaching three other Asian nations.

More:

""Currently, it can be said it is affirmative that there is the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission,"" he said in an interview with China's CCTV state broadcaster.

Zhong said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members who had visited Wuhan.

He added that 14 medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have also been infected.

Human-to-human transmission could make the virus spread more quickly and widely.

Alarm in the region

The new coronavirus strain has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

The total number of people diagnosed with the latest strain of the virus rose to 218, according to CCTV.

South Korea on Monday reported its first case - a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan.

Thailand and Japan previously confirmed a total of three cases - all of whom had visited the Chinese city.

Meanwhile, a third person died in Wuhan, according to the local health commission.

Experts believe the epidemic ""can still be controlled"", the National Health Commission said on Sunday.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said the new cases in China were the result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"".

Wuhan authorities said they have installed infrared thermometers at airports, and railway and coach stations across the city. Passengers with fever were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions.

State TV footage showed medical staff working inside an isolation ward at a Wuhan hospital in hazmat suits.

In Hong Kong, health officials said they were expanding enhanced checks on arrivals to include anyone coming in from Hubei province, not just its capital, Wuhan. More than 100 people are being monitored in the city.

Passengers are also being screened at some airports in Thailand and the United States.

Better handling

Chinese state media moved to calm the mood as discussion swelled on social media about the coronavirus spreading to other Chinese cities.

Weighing in on the matter for the first time, China's President Xi Jinping said on Monday that safeguarding people's lives should be given ""top priority"" and that the spread of the epidemic ""should be resolutely contained"", according to CCTV.

Xi said it was necessary to ""release information on the epidemic in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation"", and ensure people have a ""stable and peaceful Spring Festival"", the broadcaster said.","[-3.41011547e-02  5.14796823e-02  1.38446391e-02  4.31724079e-02

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced the first known case of a new strain of coronavirus in the US. In a Tuesday press conference, a CDC spokesman said a US citizen returning from a trip to central China had been diagnosed in Seattle.

According to the CDC, the man is in his 30s and is in good condition at a hospital in Everett, Washington after returning to the area last week.

While in China, the man traveled to the Wuhan area, where the virus is believed to originate. It has since spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai.

The US is the fifth country to report a case of the illness. Nearly 300 cases have been reported in China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. US authorities have begun screening air passengers coming from central China.

Quick guide What are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor? Show Hide What is Covid-19? Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back

a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.

Last month, health officials began reporting new cases of viral pneumonia, including symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Officials connected the patients to a food market in Wuhan.

So far there are six reported deaths, all in China. Most were 60 or older and had a previous medical condition. Although the virus likely originated from animal-to-people contact, Chinese officials this week confirmed their first case of person-to-person contraction.

CDC officials said the risk to the American public is low. According to Reuters, officials around the world have implement similar screenings to contain the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season.","[ 5.16324379e-02  2.33179685e-02  2.09089238e-02  6.16804324e-02

7,China says coronavirus can spread before symptoms show -- calling into question US containment strategy,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/26/health/coronavirus-spread-symptoms-chinese-officials/index.html,1/26/2020,edition.cnn.com,"(CNN) China's health minister Ma Xiaowei made a startling statement Sunday about the Wuhan coronavirus: He said people can spread it before they become symptomatic.

""This is a game changer,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It's much harder to contain a virus -- to track down a patient's contacts and quarantine them immediately -- if the patient was spreading the disease for days or weeks before they even realized they had it.

""It means the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought,"" said Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""This is worse than we anticipated.""

Ma didn't explain why he thinks the virus can be spread before someone has symptoms. If the Chinese health minister is right -- and there are those who doubt him -- that means the five confirmed cases in the United States might have been infectious while traveling from Wuhan to Arizona, California, Illinois and Washington state, even if they had no symptoms at the time.

On Sunday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the risk to the American public for contracting this virus continues to be low.

""We at CDC don't have clear evidence that patients are infectious before symptom onset, but we are actively investigating that possibility,"" Messonnier said.

""We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I continue to hope that it is not,"" she added.

The Wuhan coronavirus has killed more than 50 people in China and infected thousands there, and spread as far as the US, France and Canada.

'We're going to have to reevaluate our strategy'

US health officials believe the Wuhan virus has an incubation period of about two weeks, CDC officials said Friday during a media briefing.

""Based on what we know now about this virus, our concern for transmission before symptoms develop is low, so that is reassuring,"" Dr. Jennifer Layden, an epidemiologist with the Illinois Department of Health, said at the Friday briefing.

The update on Sunday from the Chinese health minister should encourage health officials to change that thinking, some infectious disease experts told CNN.

""Assuming that Ma is correct, we're going to have to re-evaluate our strategy, that's for sure,"" Schaffner said.

Dr. Paul Offit, another longtime CDC adviser, said given Ma's news, he thinks health officials should alert people on the flights that the three US patients took from Wuhan that they might have traveled with someone who was infectious.

""I think the conservative thing to do would be to cast a wider net,"" he said.

NIH doctor wants US to inspect Chinese data

The United States' top infectious disease doctor wants a team of CDC disease detectives to go to China and check on these crucial questions about how the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading.

But there's something stopping them: China first has to invite the CDC.

""Up to now, to my knowledge, we have not been invited,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health, said Sunday.

NIH and CDC are separate divisions of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

The implications of Ma's statement that the coronavirus is transmissible before symptoms are so important ""that in my mind it's absolutely critical that we ourselves see the data, because what goes on over there has implications for what happens here,"" Fauci said.

He added that to his knowledge, the Chinese did not tell US health authorities that the virus could spread before someone is symptomatic, a crucial aspect of any disease investigation. He said he learned about it after reading a CNN reporter's email.

Fauci said that CDC disease detectives would need to see precisely how Chinese health authorities have gathered their data and how they came to their conclusion.

""To my knowledge, we have not seen the precise minute, granular data and how they collected it,"" he said. ""We need to get to the real bottom line of how they collected their data and see if it's valid.""

""The Chinese have good people. I don't want to impugn their capabilities,"" Fauci added. ""But when it's something as important as this, our people who are trained epidemiologists need to go over their data and the best way to do that is go there and see how they're collecting it.""

CDC's Messonnier said Sunday the CDC has staff in China, but the team is not directly involved in the Wuhan coronavirus response. The agency hopes to have ""additional engagement"" on the outbreak in China in the coming days, she said.

In a tweet on Sunday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""I am on my way to Beijing, [China] to meet with the Government & health experts supporting the #coronavirus response. My @WHO colleagues & I would like to understand the latest developments & strengthen our partnership with [China] in providing further protection against the outbreak.""

Are Chinese officials right?

In a fast-spreading, evolving outbreak like this one, information often changes.

Some experts are skeptical because of the lack of data from China.

""I seriously doubt that the Chinese public officials have any data supporting this statement,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""I know of no evidence in 17 years of working with coronaviruses -- SARS and MERS -- where anyone has been found to be infectious during their incubation period.""

Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome are both caused by coronaviruses. While each has killed hundreds of people worldwide, together they amounted to only a handful of cases and no deaths in the United States.

Offit, on the other hand, said it wouldn't surprise him if the Chinese health minister is right and the Wuhan coronavirus can be spread while people are asymptomatic. Measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox all spread that way, he said.

Despite that, he said he's optimistic that the US can control the outbreak before it gets out of hand, as it has in China.

That's because the spread of the outbreak doesn't just rely on the time period of contagiousness. It also relies on how easily the virus spreads. Some viruses,such as measles, spread easily even to people on the other side of a room. Other viruses spread only with much closer contact.

""My gut says we're going to be able to contain this real quick -- we're going to be able to put a moat around this fire,"" said Offit, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""I think this is going to be much more like SARS or MERS than the movie 'Contagion.' ""

""But then,"" the Philadelphia-based doctor said, ""I'm an Eagles fan, so I tend to be optimistic about things.""","[-2.83461604e-02  2.45772898e-02  3.45270522e-02  5.10885119e-02

8,Saudi Arabia tries to calm oil market over coronavirus fears,https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/saudi-arabia-calm-oil-market-coronavirus-fears-200127133236911.html,1/27/2020,www.aljazeera.com,"Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, on Monday urged caution against ""gloomy expectations"" regarding the possible impact of the spread of the new coronavirus on the global economy and oil demand.

The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China rose to 81 on Monday with more than 2,700 infected, as health authorities around the world stepped up screening of passengers from China.

More:

Crude prices fell about 3 percent on Monday as the rising number of cases of the coronavirus and China's city lockdowns and extension of its Lunar New Year holiday deepened concerns over oil demand.

Oil prices had already been weighed down by oversupply and slowing demand from China. Last week, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group said the coronavirus could cause global oil demand to slip by 260,000 barrels a day, with jet fuel accounting for some two-thirds of that drop.

But Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the impact being seen on oil and other markets was ""primarily driven by psychological factors and extremely negative expectations adopted by some market participants despite its very limited impact on global oil demand"".

""Such extreme pessimism occurred back in 2003 during the SARS outbreak, though it did not cause a significant reduction in oil demand,"" the minister said in a statement.

Fellow Gulf OPEC oil producer United Arab Emirates echoed the Saudi minister's comments.

""It is important that we do not exaggerate projections related to future decreases in oil demand due to events in China,"" UAE Minister of Energy Suhail al-Mazrouei said.

In March ""OPEC and OPEC+ member countries will discuss market conditions and, if required, all options to ensure continued market balance,"" he said.

The Saudi minister said OPEC and its allies could respond to any impact on the oil market, adding he was confident the Chinese and international authorities could contain the virus.

Brent crude was down 3.1 percent at $58.82 at 1312 GMT, having earlier dropped to $58.68. US crude was down by 2.8 percent at $52.68, having earlier eased to $52.15. Both hit their lowest levels since October.

Prince Abdulaziz said he was confident the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, a group known as OPEC+, ""have the capability and flexibility needed to respond to any developments"".

Oman's oil minister told Reuters news agency on Monday that he fully supported Saudi Arabia's readiness to react to any impact the virus has on the market.

OPEC+, which includes Russia, has been reducing oil supply to support prices and has agreed to hold back 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of output until the end of March.

Prince Abdulaziz said all options would be open when OPEC+ meets in Vienna in March.

An OPEC source said on Monday that there were ""preliminary discussions"" among OPEC+ for an extension of the current oil supply cuts beyond March, and a possible deeper cut was also an option, if there was a need, and if the China virus spread impacted oil demand.","[-5.18236961e-03  9.26087741e-05  7.63369203e-02  1.02300689e-01

9,Oil prices have fallen 10% as coronavirus raises fears for global growth,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/27/business/oil-prices-coronavirus/index.html,1/27/2020,edition.cnn.com,"London (CNN Business) China's coronavirus outbreak has rattled oil markets, sending prices sharply lower as investors worry that efforts to prevent it spreading will harm the country's economy and reduce demand for crude.

Brent crude futures traded around 3% lower on Monday at $58.88 a barrel, their lowest level since October. US crude futures were down roughly 3%.

The price of Brent, the global benchmark, has tumbled by about 10% since January 17, when Chinese authorities confirmed the death of a second person infected with the virus. It has spread rapidly since then, leading the Chinese government to impose restrictions on transportation. Full, or partial lockdowns, are in effect in 15 Chinese cities, covering 60 million people.

The death toll now stands at 80, with nearly 3,000 confirmed cases in mainland China and more than 50 in other places including the United States.

""As the human cost continues to rise, investors have become increasingly concerned about the potential economic consequences of the disease,"" analysts at Rabobank said in a research note.

10,Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 82 as China extends holiday,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51259649,1/27/2020,www.bbc.com,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Road blocks and ghost towns: Inside the province where the virus originated

The number of people killed in China by the new coronavirus has risen to 82, with almost 3,000 confirmed ill.

The national new year holiday has been extended by three days to Sunday, in an attempt to contain the spread.

The number of deaths in Hubei rose from 56 to 76, with six deaths elsewhere. Wuhan is in lockdown and several other cities have imposed travel bans.

At least 44 cases have been confirmed abroad, including in Germany, the United States, and Australia.

There have been no deaths outside China.

On Monday, authorities in Beijing confirmed a 50-year-old man had died - the first fatality in the Chinese capital from the virus.

In Shanghai, the government has stopped businesses from returning to work until 10 February. The ban applies to all companies apart from utilities, medical firms, medical suppliers, and supermarkets.

Meanwhile, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is in Beijing to discuss the outbreak with the Chinese government and health experts.

The BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai says extending the main holiday of the year is a highly unusual move. But after the pre-new year travel surge, the prospect of half a billion people getting back on trains, planes and buses and criss-crossing the country again is the last thing the government wants, he adds.

On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and centre of the outbreak.

Experts suspect many more people are infected, but actual figures are hard to ascertain due to a number of factors like some people being asymptomatic.

Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, London, told the UK's Guardian newspaper his ""best guess"" put the number at 100,000 infected, while figures put together by the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong suggest the number was closer to 43,000.

However, the University of Hong Kong research also suggested that - without public health intervention - tens of thousands more could be infected every day when the outbreak reaches its height. As a result of their projections, Gabriel Leung, the dean of the faculty of Medicine, was advising ""substantial, draconian measures"" to limit population mobility.

The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine.

Most of the deaths have been of elderly people or those with pre-existing respiratory problems.

What is happening in Wuhan?

Travel from the city, home to 11 million people, has been severely restricted and non-essential vehicles have been banned from the roads.

At the Hubei border, workers are checking people's temperatures before allowing them into the province.

The local government in Wuhan said no-one from the city had left China in the past four days. Some 4,096 tourists from Wuhan are still out of the country, while five million new year travellers left the city before the lockdown.

More than half a million medical staff have joined the province's prevention, control and treatment operations, while two makeshift hospitals are being built.

What is the situation in China?

New year celebrations were scaled back and four major cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Tianjin - have banned long-distance buses.

Schools and official institutions will remain closed for the rest of this week.

Beijing has closed the Forbidden City for tourists, as well as a section of the Great Wall. Both Disney parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai have closed.

In Guangdong province, several cities have made face masks mandatory in public.

Hong Kong, which has eight confirmed cases, has declared a city-wide emergency, with schools closed until 17 February. Mongolia - which has yet to record a case of the virus - has closed its border with China. It has also closed schools until 2 March, and banned public events.

Meanwhile, He Qinghua, a top official with China's National Health Commission, told reporters some areas still ""lack determination in controlling the epidemic"", according to the state-run newspaper Global Times. He said rural villages, in particular, were failing to deal with the crisis ""in a timely manner"".

Over the weekend, Chinese officials warned the virus was able to spread during its incubation period, believed to be between one and 14 days, making it harder to contain the illness.

What is the situation internationally?

According to the World Health Organization and national authorities, there have been at least 47 confirmed cases outside China.

The latest case to be confirmed is in the German state of Bavaria, only the fourth so far in Europe.

Eight cases: Thailand

Thailand Five: USA, Australia, Singapore

USA, Australia, Singapore Four: Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea

Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea Three: France, Japan

France, Japan Two: Vietnam

Vietnam One: Nepal, Canada, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Germany

In the UK, 73 people have been tested - but no-one has resulted to have contracted the virus.

Almost all had recently been to Wuhan or had been in close contact with someone who had.

Where did the virus emerge?

The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.

Authorities have since temporarily banned the sale of all wildlife in China. The virus itself is a new, or ""novel"" coronavirus - a family that normally affects animals.

'As long as we leave, they don't mind'

Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hubei / Henan

Police and officials in the impact zone in Hubei and Henan provinces are now very keen to move us on wherever we arrive.

They don't seem to mind where we go - as long as we leave their towns.

We explain that the world wants to see the important, tiring work they're doing to combat the virus. But they're not interested. It could be that they're worried that our presence might imply to some that their patch is not handling this emergency well enough.

One police officer at the entrance to a small town in Henan said to me: ""We don't have a problem here any more so there's no need for you to be here.""

He said this at a checking station as cars were being pulled up behind him. Medical staff covered head to toe in protective clothing were then screening every passenger.

They also checked the inside of all vehicles. I'm not sure what they were looking for - but it certainly didn't look like business as usual.

What can people do to stay safe?

The World Health Organization (WHO) advises its ""standard recommendations"" focusing on ""hand and respiratory hygiene"".

That essentially means washing hands or using disinfectants, and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

The advice also suggests avoiding contact with live animals in places where there have been coronavirus cases, and not to eat raw or uncooked animal products.

11,Coronavirus: Foreign Office warns against 'all but essential travel' to China,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51288672,1/28/2020,www.bbc.com,"Image copyright AFP/Getty

The Foreign Office is warning Britons not to travel to mainland China, unless their journey is essential.

It comes as Britons in Hubei Province, at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, prepare to be flown home as early as Thursday.

The virus has caused more than 100 deaths, spreading across China and to at least 16 other countries.

There have been no confirmed cases in the UK so far, with 97 people testing negative for the virus.

The FCO had already warned against all travel to Hubei Province, saying anyone there who could leave should do so.

Its new advice warns against ""all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao)"".

It warns the Chinese government is imposing further restrictions on movement, adding: ""It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so.""

The FCO is arranging to evacuate Britons from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, urging those who want to leave to contact the British consulate before 11:00 local time on Wednesday.

Up to 300 British people are thought to be in the area, which is now under strict travel restrictions. Officials estimate as many as 200 of them will want to return to the UK.

One teacher in Wuhan, the capital city of the province, told the Press Association UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights - with some understood to be scheduled to fly back on Thursday morning.

'Cities could be closed at short notice'

Travel journalist Simon Calder told BBC News the FCO's change of advice was ""extremely significant"".

""My estimate is that there are around 10,000 holidaymakers in China at the moment and many thousands more who are on business or living as expatriates,"" he said.

""The Foreign Office is being clear that it is not overly concerned with people who are there at the moment, it is more that they want to manage the scale of any possible problems.

""At the moment people can fly freely in and out of Beijing and Shanghai - the Foreign Office appears to be concerned that cities like that could be closed at short notice.""

Mr Calder said airlines flying from the UK to China ""have all said that they will provide refunds and anyone booked on a package holiday due to depart imminently will be entitled to a full refund"".

Those with packages booked to depart beyond the next week or so may be told to wait and see by their travel company, in case the FCO changes its advice.

""Anyone who travels to China against the Foreign Office advice risks invalidating their insurance,"" he added.

Amie Keeley, head of news at Travel Weekly, said it was a quiet time for organised tours in China, but operators had been offering customers with bookings later in the year refunds or alternative travel dates.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was ""working urgently to finalise arrangements for an assisted departure from Hubei Province for British nationals this week, and are in contact with people in Hubei to ensure they register their interest and that we can keep them updated"".

Britons have also been advised by the FCO to ""comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities"".

British Airways said it was assessing its schedule of flights to China, while Virgin Atlantic said its flights to Shanghai woud continue to operate as usual.

A UK expert developing a vaccine against the virus has said it has a ""very good chance"" of being effective.

Professor Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said he plans to start testing the vaccine on animals by the middle of February, with human studies in the summer if enough funding is secured.

Britons in parts of China affected by the virus have been criticising the UK government for not doing enough to help them leave.

Some in Wuhan said they had been given little information, compared with those from other countries. The US and Japan have been sending planes to Wuhan to evacuate their citizens.

Meanwhile, tests on people who have returned to the UK from the area are continuing.

One man currently being tested was filmed as he left home in Harborne, Birmingham, on Monday, on his way to hospital.

A video posted on Twitter by a neighbour showed him being escorted to an ambulance by a medic wearing a protective suit.

Earlier, Public Health England in the West Midlands said blood tests on the man were ongoing but it later said it was not in a position to comment on individual cases and would not provide rolling updates on tests.

It said testing for coronavirus involved taking samples from the patient's nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and sending them to a laboratory which could provide a result within 24 hours.

12,Coronavirus: Worldwide cases overtake 2003 Sars outbreak,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51322733,1/31/2020,www.bbc.com,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus

The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003.

There were around 8,100 cases of Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - reported during the eight-month outbreak.

But nearly 10,000 cases of the new virus have been confirmed, most in China, since it emerged in December.

More than 100 cases have been reported outside China, in 22 countries.

The number of deaths so far stands at 213 - all in China. In total, 774 people were killed by Sars.

On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency over the new outbreak.

The UK on Friday confirmed its first two cases of the virus.

In another development, the US also declared a public health emergency and said it would bar any foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks from entering the country.

Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the true total number of cases could be far higher than official figures suggest. Based on mathematical models of the outbreak, experts there say more than 75,000 people may have been infected in the Chinese city of Wuhan alone, where the virus originated.

Most cases outside China are in people who have been to Wuhan. But Germany, Japan, Vietnam, the United States, Thailand and South Korea have reported person-to-person cases - patients being infected by people who had travelled to China.

Wuhan's Communist Party chief said on Friday the city should have taken measures sooner to contain the virus.

""If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,"" Ma Guoqiang told state broadcaster CCTV.

As governments around the world acted to contain the virus, WHO spokesman Chris Lindmeier warned that closing borders could in fact accelerate its spread, with travellers entering countries unofficially.

""As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases, whenever people want to travel, they will. And if the official paths are not opened, they will find unofficial paths,"" he said.

He said the best way to track the virus was at official border crossings.

How does this outbreak compare to Sars?

Sars was a type of coronavirus that first emerged in China's Guangdong province in November 2002. By the time the outbreak ended the following July, it had spread to more than two dozen countries.

The new coronavirus emerged only last month. So far, it has spread to fewer countries and - while more people have been infected globally - it has resulted in fewer deaths.

On Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases within China surpassed the Sars epidemic.

Sars was also estimated to have cost the global economy more than $30bn (£22bn).

But economists have said the new coronavirus could have an even bigger impact on the world economy. It has forced global companies including tech giants, car makers and retailers to shut down temporarily in China.

China was also criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the original Sars outbreak.

It has been praised for responding to the latest virus with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities.

But in his interview with CCTV on Friday, the Wuhan Communist Party chief said transport restrictions should have been brought in at least 10 days earlier.

""The epidemic may have been alleviated somewhat, and not got to the current situation,"" Mr Ma said.

The estimates from the University of Hong Kong suggest the epidemic is doubling in size roughly every week and that multiple Chinese cities may have imported sufficient cases to start local epidemics.

""Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could potentially also become outbreak epicentres because of substantial spread of pre-symptomatic cases unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately,"" Professor Joseph Wu said.

Harder to spot and harder to stop

Why is this outbreak more difficult to stop than Sars?

The answer is not down to China - the speed and scale of the country's response to this new virus is widely considered to be unprecedented. The difference is the way the virus behaves inside the human body.

Sars was a brutal infection that you couldn't miss - patients were contagious only when they had symptoms. This made it relatively easy to isolate the sick and quarantine anyone who might have been exposed.

But the new virus, 2019-nCov, is harder to spot and therefore harder to stop.

From the virus's perspective, it has a far smarter evolutionary survival strategy than Sars.

The best estimate is only one-in-five cases cause severe symptoms, so instead of infected people turning up in hospital, you have to go out and find them.

And we are getting detailed documented cases of people spreading the virus before they even have symptoms.

There is a tendency to focus only on how deadly a virus is. But it is this, in combination with a virus's ability to spread, that determines its true threat.

How is China handling this?

A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has now reached every region in mainland China.

The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, which is at the heart of the outbreak.

The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. People who have been in Hubei are also being told to work from home.

China has said it will send charter planes to bring back Hubei residents who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". A foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the ""practical difficulties"" Chinese citizens had faced abroad.

The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country.

How is the world responding?

Voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals from Wuhan are under way.

The UK, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion.

Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas Island, 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland in a detention centre that has been used to house asylum seekers.

13,Coronavirus death toll rises to 258 as US and others impose strict travel restrictions,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/30/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-update-intl-hnk/index.html,1/31/2020,edition.cnn.com,"Hong Kong (CNN) The United States and other countries issued strict travel restrictions for foreign nationals who traveled to China as the number of deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak continued rising on Friday.

A day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global health emergency , Chinese authorities reported 45 deaths, all of them in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak of which Wuhan is the capital, bringing the total death toll across the country to 258.

As of Friday, there were more than 10,000 coronavirus cases confirmed in China, authorities said, an increase of over 2,000 from the previous day. That surpasses the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that began in southern China, which infected 8,098 people worldwide, killing 774.

More than 20 countries and territories outside of mainland China have confirmed cases of the virus -- spanning Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East -- as the United Kingdom reported its first two cases on Friday.

On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last two weeks and could pose a risk of spreading the virus, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.

Foreign nationals who are the immediate family of US citizens or permanent residents are exempt. US citizens returning to the United States who have been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks before their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine, Azar said.

The decision by the WHO prompted governments to upgrade their own response to the virus, with the US State Department raising its travel advisory for China to it's highest level: Do not travel.

The WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as ""an extraordinary event"" that constitutes a ""public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease,"" and ""to potentially require a coordinated international response."" Previous emergencies have included Ebola, Zika and H1N1.

Ghebreyesus, who met this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, said the WHO ""continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak.""

""We would have seen many more cases outside China by now -- and probably deaths -- if it were not for the government's efforts,"" he added.

Much of China goes back to work on Monday, after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended in an attempt to rein in the virus. The fear now -- as tens of millions of people travel across the country and cities return to usual business -- is that new self-sustaining epidemic spots will rear up.

Many schools and universities across the country will remain closed for much of next week.

Evacuation and spread

As Wuhan and much of Hubei remains on lockdown in a bid to contain the virus, many countries have begun extracting their citizens from the city.

A charter plane carrying more than 350 South Koreans landed at Gimpo International Airport near Seoul on Friday, following flights organized by the US and Japan to evacuate their citizens. Multiple other governments, including the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are still arranging flights.

Meanwhile, more cases of the virus have been reported worldwide. Singapore confirmed three additional cases Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the city to 13.

Health officials said all 13 cases are in a stable condition and ""most are improving."" They also advised citizens to ""defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China.""

The Singapore government said it will distribute four masks each to 1.3 million households in the city from Saturday. Other Asian territories, particularly Hong Kong, have struggled to maintain supply of masks, with many stores running out following an initial rush by residents to stock up.

More than 130 infections with the virus -- but no deaths -- have been reported outside mainland China.

The UK has confirmed its first two cases of Wuhan coronavirus in the northwest of England, according to a statement by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England.

""We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS (National Health Service) care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,"" he said.

""The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread,"" he added.

""We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.""

Two of China's neighbors have instituted emergency measures to try and stop the virus spreading there. Russia said it was closing its border in the Far East, and limiting rail services from all of China from January 31. Meanwhile, North Korea declared a state of emergency and said it was instituting a ""hygienic and anti-epidemic"" response.

Work continues on Wuhan Huoshenshan hospital on January 30, 2020 in Wuhan, China. The 1,000-bed hospital is scheduled to open on February 5.

Facing a long quarantine

Much of Hubei has been under effective quarantine for weeks now, with almost every city facing travel restrictions in a province home to nearly 60 million people. Wuhan has been completely locked down, with residents cooped up in their homes and the streets abandoned.

Foreigners being airlifted out of the city are also facing up to two weeks of mandatory or voluntary quarantine once they land in their home countries.

However, this has sparked controversy in some countries, especially in Australia, where a plan to house evacuees in a former detention center for migrants on Christmas Island has generated no small amount of negative publicity .

Public broadcaster ABC spoke to some Australians in Wuhan who said they would rather remain in the city than face two weeks on what has been described by some opposition lawmakers as a ""leper camp,"" even as Canberra defended its decision as the only place capable of quarantining hundreds of people.

At March Air Reserve Base in Southern California, where US evacuees were flown earlier this week, one man said he was willing to remain under quarantine ""as long as I need.""

Jarred Evans said that the US Centers for Disease Control told evacuees that the initial 72-hour quarantine that was suggested ""is really not enough time, but you know, they're not obligated to keep us here.""

""You're not obligated to leave (when the 72 hours are up), so they're saying that the best thing for you, your people, your family and the community is to stay as long as possible,"" Evans said.

After flying out of near-freezing temperatures in Wuhan, Evans said he and the other passengers were spending time outdoors enjoying the sunny, 22 degrees Celsius (72F) weather.

""We're all still taking major precautions. So it's not like we're around here hugging each other and shaking hands and things like that,"" Evans said. ""We're wearing our masks ... But honestly, you know, everyone is enjoying themselves because what we experienced, what we've seen, is very serious, you know, people are dying. So when you see that and think about things like that, try to take as much appreciation of what is in front of you.""

What happens next?

Speaking on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry said the country had full ""confidence and capability"" in winning the fight against the virus.

""Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Chinese government has been taking the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures with a high sense of responsibility for people's health,"" said ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in a statement. ""Many of these measures go well beyond the requirements of the International Health Regulations. We have full confidence and capability to win this fight against the epidemic.""

China has taken major measures to try and contain the epidemic, locking much of Hubei down, partially closing the border with Hong Kong and extending the Lunar New Year holiday, all of which could have a severe drain on the country's economy, already vulnerable due to the US-China trade war.

With most people due to go back to work on Monday, it remains unclear whether more measures will be announced, and if not, how this will influence the spread of the virus.

Health experts previously estimated that the number of cases could be far higher than currently confirmed. Researchers at Imperial College London have estimated that at least 4,000 people were infected in Wuhan by January 18, almost a week before the lockdown began. Their model suggests a low national figure of 20,000 infections by the end of the month, potentially as high as 100,000.

Researchers in Hong Kong estimate there could be 75,815 people in Wuhan infected with coronavirus as of January 25, according to a paper published Friday in The Lancet.
