A few days later, Sars was ruled out, but the illness continued to spread, with travelers being checked to prevent further infections. On January 10, a death was reported, and on January 15, Japan confirmed its first case of coronavirus infection. On January 20, a vaccine was being developed, and it became clear that human-to-human transmission was possible as the number of cases tripled and spread to Beijing and Shanghai. From that point on, the virus has spread across the world, causing widespread panic and uncertainty, leading to lockdowns, travel restrictions, and economic disruptions. \n",

The timeline of the virus spread throughout China and the rest of the world is the main storyline of the narrative map, with each event adding to the urgency of the situation and the need for a coordinated and effective response. The impact on the Chinese government is a secondary storyline, as the government struggled to contain the outbreak and maintain credibility with its citizens, leading to criticism and calls for transparency and accountability. The efforts to develop a vaccine are the third storyline, with scientists racing to find a way to prevent further infections and contain the spread of the virus. \n",
